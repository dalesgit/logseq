- Centering prayer last night. #names Tom, lives in Highland Lakes, told an amazing story of a giant spider's web as a symbol of God's creation, of which we are a part of the web.
- #names Roxie, the tall spindly person, approached us inquiring about our newly started meeting. She has issues with her husband that has kept her away. She is looking to augment her Monday evening session.
