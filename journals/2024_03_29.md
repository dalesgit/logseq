	- pretty easy, but I'm not certain I know how to manipulate the files. Nice that it is just vim.

		- Liturgical scholar [Leonel Mitchell](https://www.amazon.com/Lent-Holy-Easter-Great-Fifty/dp/1561011347?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=livingchurc0b-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=e1810bcbc1cf7e6474d0f56034cab376&camp=1789&creative=9325) puts it well:
			- The Good Friday liturgy is a solemn commemoration of and participation in the great events of this day, the salvation of the human race through the victory of Christ, who by dying destroyed death, not a funeral for Jesus. The older custom of wearing black vestments, and the Anglican custom in some places of vesting choir and acolyte in black cassocks without surplices on this day, tends to reinforce the funeral theme. This latter custom apparently stems from the recognition that the Three Hours was not a liturgical service, hence the “vestments” were not worn, but only the cassock, the “street dress” of the clergy. The liturgical color of today is Holy Week red, for Christ the King of martyrs, and albs or surplices are appropriately worn.
