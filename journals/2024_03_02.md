	- What are days for?
	  Days are where we live.
	  They come, they wake us
	  Time and time over.
	  They are to be happy in:
	  Where can we live but days?
	- An excerpt from the poem *‘Day’* by Philip Larkin and the opening of the Netflix show *‘One Day.’*
	- In the last episode, Emma reads a passage from Thomas Hardy’s *Tess of the D’Ubervilles*. The paragraph still haunts me a few days after I finished the show for the third time, and it compels me to write about death once again.
	- Before going any further, let me share the passage with you:
	- > She philosophically noted dates as they came past in the revolution of the year. Her own birthday, and every other day individualized by incidents in which she had taken some share. She suddenly thought one afternoon that there was yet another date of greater importance. Her own death. A day which lay sly and unseen among all the other days of the year, but not less surely there.
	- When was it?
