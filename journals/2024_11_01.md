	- What is Lebanon’s ancient city of Baalbek and why is Israel targeting it? | Israel attacks Lebanon | Al Jazeera
		- Israel this week issued a citywide evacuation order for the first time since it stepped up its attacks on Lebanon in late September.
		- Tens of thousands of people have fled Baalbek, the largest city in eastern Lebanon, following Israeli forced displacement calls for the city and its surrounding villages.
		- Israel’s orders on Wednesday and Thursday saying it was preparing to attack targets of the Lebanese group Hezbollah were followed by strikes on the city.
		- On Wednesday, the initial displacement order caused immediate alarm.
		- “People are panicking, running around in confusion, bumping into each other, unsure where to go or what to do,” said Roula Zeaiter, programme manager for RDFL (The Lebanese Women Democratic Gathering), describing how crowded neighbourhoods, many housing displaced families fleeing Israeli bombardment in Lebanon’s south and the surrounding areas, emptied quickly.
		- “Minutes after the order to leave came, the streets were filled with people grabbing their things, locking their homes and closing their shops,” Zeaiter told RDFL’s partner organisation, ActionAid. “We’re scrambling like scared mice, moving from place to place. Lebanon is becoming like Gaza, with Israeli forces using the same tactics.”

		- The latest news from around the world. Timely. Accurate. Fair.
		- Hours after the forced displacement call on Wednesday, air attacks hit the city and its surroundings, confirmed Baalbek mayor Mustafa al-Shall.
		- Nineteen people were killed, including eight women, the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health reported.
		- ## What is Baalbek known for?
		- The city of about 80,000 overlooks the Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.
		- Baalbek is considered part of the Hezbollah group’s heartland in the Bekaa Valley.
		- It is believed to be an ancient Phoenician city and is home to some of the world’s best-preserved Roman ruins, such as the Temple of Bacchus.
		- Baalbek was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984 for its ancient Roman temple complex. UNESCO describes these temples as “one of the finest examples of Imperial Roman architecture at its apogee” and they draw tourists from around the world.
		- Tourism supports much of the local population, but so too do agriculture and traditional crafts such as rug-making and copperwork.
		- As Israel targets Baalbek, some residents are sheltering at the temples in the hope that the ruins’ cultural heritage status could confer protection, NPR reports.
		- ## Why is Israel targeting Baalbek?
			- - According to the Israeli military, Hezbollah has military installations within the city.
			  - Translation: #عاجل Urgent warning to the residents of Baalbek, Ain Bourday and Douris
			    🔸 You are in a combat zone where the IDF (Israeli army) intends to attack and target Hezbollah infrastructure, interests, installations and combat means, and does not intend to harm you.  
			    🔸 Staying in the red zone puts you and your family at risk.  
			    🔸 For your safety, we urge you to evacuate your homes immediately and move out of these areas via the following routes:‼️ Zahle – Baalbek highway‼️ Nahle – Baalbek Road‼️ Cedar Road – Baalbek  
			  - “Earlier today … the air force struck command and control centres and terrorist infrastructure that were used by the Hezbollah terrorist organisation in the areas of Baalbek deep in Lebanon, and Nabatieh in southern Lebanon,” the Israeli military said in a statement Thursday.
		- ## Has Israel always issued evacuation orders during its assault on Lebanon?
			- - No.
			  - On Tuesday, before the residents of Baalbek were ordered to evacuate, Israel struck several towns in the Bekaa Valley, killing 60.
			  - None of these towns received any warning.
			  - While Israel claims to target Hezbollah, residents of the targeted towns, Lebanese officials and rights groups say the air attacks are indiscriminate.
			  - There have been other instances of Israel striking civilian targets without warning.
			  - Earlier this week, five people were killed and 33 injured in an air attack on Haret Saida in Sidon, in the south of Lebanon. A resident told the AP the victims were civilians.
			  - In mid-October, 21 people were killed and eight injured in an unannounced strike on the predominantly Christian village of Aitou in northern Lebanon. The strike hit a house rented to displaced families. Residents said there was no warning.
			  - About a week later, 13 people, including a child, were killed in an Israeli attack on an area near the Rafik Hariri University Hospital, Lebanon’s biggest public health facility, in the capital Beirut. Though warnings were issued for the southern suburbs before they were hit with heavy strikes, the attack around the hospital came without warning.
			  - Israel and Hezbollah started trading cross-border attacks a day after the war on Gaza began on October 7, 2023. Hezbollah claimed it was supporting Gaza and pressuring Israel for a ceasefire.
			  - Then, in late September, Israel expanded its assault on Lebanon.
			  - In Lebanon, at least 2,867 people have been killed and 13,047 wounded in Israeli attacks since October 2023. The Lebanese Health Ministry says 45 people have been killed across the country in the past 24 hours. More than 188,000 people have been displaced in that time.

		  Starting out as a single restaurant in Columbus, Ohio, in 1969 when fast food was still a novelty on the American food scene, Wendy's grew into one of the largest restaurant chains in the U.S. Throughout its history, and into the present, Wendy's has positioned itself as a tried-and-true hamburger-and-fries-focused restaurant, but to compete with its more dominant sector-mates like McDonald's and Burger King, it's always done things a little bit differently. Its burger patties are square, it famously serves a melty, malty concoction called the Frosty instead of a milkshake, and the menu offers unique and even healthy fare like chili and baked potatoes as well as fat-laden monster sandwiches like the Baconator.
		  
		  **Forever an underdog because it's been unable to reach the breadth or income level of McDonald's, Wendy's has shown signs of struggle in recent years**. Will the chain created and curated by founder and spokesperson Dave Thomas so long ago get swallowed up by the fast food industry it helped normalize? It very well could. Here are all the things that could point to Wendy's not being around forever.
		  
		  ## Wendy's is closing down a lot of stores
		  
		    ![pickup window closed sign](https://www.thetakeout.com/img/gallery/signs-wendys-may-not-be-around-much-longer/wendys-is-closing-down-a-lot-of-stores-1729866170.jpg)

		  [The world's first Wendy's location is sadly no more](https://www.thetakeout.com/1675241/worlds-first-wendys-location-closed/), and so are a lot more Wendy's stores as of late. While there are well over 6,000 Wendy's locations open for business in the U.S. in 2024, only a few hundred of those are company-owned. And in a sign that the business might be suffering some problems, **Wendy's announced plans to close down more than 100 of its outlets in 2024**. In the first three months of the year, it already shut down shops at a rate of one every three days.
		  
		  The decision to abruptly close down such a substantial portion of its portfolio came on the heels of [Wendy's changing its mind about the future](https://www.thetakeout.com/wendys-locations-menu-change-for-future-ghost-kitchens-1850180986/). In 2023, it walked back an aggressive plan to move more into food delivery. Some locales are now unable to secure their Wendy's food in any way, which means things don't necessarily bode well for Wendy's even as it recalibrates and sets off on a plan to open new restaurants while simultaneously closing others (it's one of [the many fast food restaurants shutting down stores in 2024](https://www.thetakeout.com/1591318/fast-food-chains-closing-in-2024/)).
		  
		  ## It's big breakfast gambit wasn't wildly successful
		  
		    ![Wendy's store advertising breakfast](https://www.thetakeout.com/img/gallery/signs-wendys-may-not-be-around-much-longer/its-big-breakfast-gambit-wasnt-wildly-successful-1729866170.jpg)

		  There's a lot of money to be made in the fast food breakfast sector — McDonald's dominates it with more than $2 billion in annual sales of [its Egg McMuffin](https://www.thetakeout.com/1642989/mcdonalds-breakfast-sandwich-scrambled-eggs/) and other morning offerings. McDonald's also pioneered a.m. fast food in the 1970s, and it's been difficult for its competitors to cut into its business, particularly Wendy's. The smaller burger chain has tried several times to launch a nationwide breakfast menu, and each time in the past, they've failed. Attempts in 1985, 2007, and 2012 all proved unpopular with customers and thus unprofitable. [Wendy's new breakfast menu finally debuted in 2020](https://www.thetakeout.com/a-taste-test-of-wendys-new-breakfast-menu-from-baconat-1841974253/), and although it's lasted for a company-record four years, the $20 million, heavily-advertised gamble hasn't fully paid off yet.
		  
		  In 2024, Wendy's CEO Kirk Tanner pledged to spend another $25 million over the next year to make breakfast stick, which he claims the chain's customers enjoy. "Breakfast remains an incredibly important daypart," Tanner said in an earnings call (via [RetailWire](https://retailwire.com/wendys-breakfast-q2-earnings/)). "It is highly profitable, and we have not yet reached our potential." Many gains in breakfast can be attributable to a bargain-priced, low-profit $3 item bundling promotion, while Wendy's overall missed its second quarter earnings projections by $7 million. **Breakfast may be a modest success, but it's not enough to take Wendy's to the next level of fast food supremacy.**
		  
		  ## A major Wendy's operator went out of business
		  
		    ![Wendy's sign on wall with palm trees](https://www.thetakeout.com/img/gallery/signs-wendys-may-not-be-around-much-longer/a-major-wendys-operator-went-out-of-business-1729866170.jpg)

		  There are slightly more than 7,000 Wendy's locations in the United States. A scant 400 or so are owned and operated by Wendy's itself, leaving the remaining 6,600 to be operated by franchisees. In this type of structure, individual proprietors pay substantial fees to the parent company for the right to sell its products and use its imagery, and then profits are split between the two entities. Such a model lets franchisees function like small business owners but with a safety net of a nationally advertised, well-known brand. But when those franchised locations fail or close, the individual proprietors suffer the financial consequences while the restaurant brand suffers a hit to its reputation.
		  
		  Nearly ¾ of Wendy's franchisees own and run 10 restaurants or less. If one of those eateries goes under, Wendy's on the whole can absorb the blow. **When one of its bigger operators goes out of business, it's potentially a huge financial loss for Wendy's at large**, and it could be a harbinger of future issues, too. In late 2023, the Starboard Group filed for bankruptcy protection, citing prohibitively expensive business costs and interest rates. Just before the declaration, Starboard shut down nine of its 61 Wendy's franchises. Such a business decision likely means many more of that restaurant group's Wendy's outlets will close down, too.
		  
		  ## Wendy's struggles to open more international locations

		  Most of the most famous fast food brands started in the United States before establishing themselves overseas. Collectively, the 10 biggest American quick-serve restaurants operate 66,000 outlets outside of the U.S. While the domestic fast food industry could become saturated sooner rather than later, the biggest opportunities for growth are thus everywhere else. **Unfortunately for Wendy's, expansion into some of the most particularly promising and lucrative areas abroad will be challenging, if not outright impossible.**
		  
		  Only ⅓ of all McDonald's locations are in the U.S.; more than 80% of Wendy's operate stateside. Wendy's trails the competition in part so badly because it's hamstrung by legal rulings from opening restaurants in Europe. Collectively, the 27 member nations of the European Union represent the biggest economic market in the world. Wendy's tentatively opened a few stores in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg in the 1970s and 1980s, but they flopped and closed down. Meanwhile, a Dutch restaurateur opened an eatery called Wendy's in 1988 and trademarked the name in 1995. The U.S. Wendy's and the European Wendy's have engaged in many court battles — but the European Wendy's always emerges victorious as the rights-holder. The more famous Wendy's keeps trying to set up shop in Europe, opening some locations in the non-E.U. United Kingdom in recent years and securing agreements to try out Ireland and Romania.
		  
		  ## It got a lot of bad press over a dynamic pricing plan
		  
		    ![Wendy's drive-thru sign](https://www.thetakeout.com/img/gallery/signs-wendys-may-not-be-around-much-longer/it-got-a-lot-of-bad-press-over-a-dynamic-pricing-plan-1729866170.jpg)

		  In 2024, Wendy's publicly floated a plan to change its pricing structure. Whether it was a publicity stunt purposely staged to get people talking online about the fast food brand, or if that virality was some negative unwanted attention over a very real business plan, the whole episode is indicative of a company that might be flailing. [Wendy's unveiled its worst idea ever](https://www.thetakeout.com/wendys-menu-new-dynamic-pricing-higher-cost-fast-food-1851289769/), theoretically, in early 2024: dynamic, or surge pricing. Similar to what ride-share services like Uber do, Wendy's flirted with charging customers more during its most consistently busiest hours. "Beginning as early as 2025, we will begin testing more enhanced features like dynamic pricing," Wendy's CEO Kirk Tanner said in a February 2024 earnings call (via [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/02/28/1234412431/wendys-dynamic-surge-pricing)). Tanner was speaking mainly about the chain's rollout of digital menus, which can be altered at any time — Wendy's can even change the prices of its fare.
		  
		  Shortly after the earnings call highlight received a lot of media attention, Wendy's had to publicly explain itself. **The company had internally discussed lowering prices on breakfast items during less busy times of the day, and claims to have never considered raising prices.**
		  
		  ## Chain-wide revenues aren't looking good
		  
		    ![Wendy's tall road sign blue sky](https://www.thetakeout.com/img/gallery/signs-wendys-may-not-be-around-much-longer/chain-wide-revenues-arent-looking-good-1729866170.jpg)

		  To the big companies, the ones that play around with hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars and track their financial health by constantly examining the fluctuations of its stock price, nothing matters more than growth. Revenues, and the value of the stock, need to be consistently moving in a healthy and upward fashion. **If a fast food mega-chain's revenues are growing, but only in small amounts, that's almost as bad as stagnation or a decline**. In recent financial periods, Wendy's has enjoyed upticks in revenues but they're so small that they worry investors. Paired with data that suggests fewer overall customer visits to Wendy's, it could spell a dark future for the burger chain.
		  
		  Analysts predicted that Wendy's could expect to enjoy a 6% rate of growth in 2024, notes [BNN Bloomberg](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/08/01/wendys-cuts-sales-guidance-as-us-guest-counts-drop/). But after looking at its figures following the second quarter of the year, the restaurant company announced that its sales would rise by somewhere around 3% to 5%. As far as customers, rates were down by 2%, suggesting that diners with less income weren't going to Wendy's as often as they once did while customers with more income were dining there more often but spending less money than they once might have.
		  
		  ## Wendy's is facing several lawsuits
		  
		    ![Wendy's exterior with sunroom broken window](https://www.thetakeout.com/img/gallery/signs-wendys-may-not-be-around-much-longer/wendys-is-facing-several-lawsuits-1729866170.jpg)

		  By and large, lawsuits are just plain bad for business. Not only do they eat up precious company resources in the form of legal fees and potentially large settlement payouts in the event of a loss, but they also can profoundly and negatively impact standard operating procedure, which is to say nothing of the negative press and customer ire that may transpire. In recent years, Wendy's has faced a number of courtroom challenges over marketing, food, and health issues. In 2023, Wendy's emerged victorious in a class action lawsuit accusing the chain of false advertising, alleging that its actual products didn't resemble at all the appetizing burgers shown in photos in commercials and on its website. Wendy's reached a financial settlement in another class action suit filed by ex-employees who alleged that the company broke Illinois state laws by collecting biometric information from its workers without their consent. The company agreed to pay out $18 million in damages.
		  
		  **In 2024, the parents of 11-year-old Aspen Lamfers filed suit against Wendy's, alleging that their daughter's consumption of a Biggie Bag in 2022 led her to contract an E. coli infection**. After experiencing stage three kidney failure, Lamfers endured permanent and profound neurological damage.
