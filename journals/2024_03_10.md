	- From the very beginning, faith, hope, and love are planted deep within our nature—indeed they are our very nature (Romans 5:5, 8:14–17). The Christian life is simply a matter of becoming who we already are (1 John 3:1–2, 2 Peter 1:3–4). But we have to awaken, allow, and advance this core identity by saying a conscious yes to it and drawing upon it as a reliable and Absolute Source.*9 Again, image must become likeness. And even a good theology will have a hard time making up for a bad anthropology. If the human person is a “pile of manure,” even the “snow of Christ” only covers it and does not undo it.
