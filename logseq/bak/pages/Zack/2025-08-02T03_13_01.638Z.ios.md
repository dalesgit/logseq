	- I want on a big long jag telling him an overview of my 20s. That I wanted to go deeper into spirituality and mysticism and it was a matter of taking one step forward learning about closed doors and period. 
	  
	  I have sketched out a map of what he wanted out of life. She came up with two things to begin with Musick and helping people with his music. Ended up talking about all the things that it would take to support pursuing that. It seemed beyond him.
	  
	  I said things like supporting himself, struck me as hanging over him like a black cloud or an weight.
	  
	  I asked about drug use and he opened up way more than he has in the past. Oxy or that kind of drug is his drug of choice. It all started, of course, with alcohol. He said that he hasn't gone without drug use for more than a week and quite a long time. I assume that primarily means cannabis.
	  
	  Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne we're at the root of his musical inspiration. He describes his father as passing that interest on him. He has a lot of tattoos, the most recent being an elaborate crucifix marking his journey in Christianity. That is a beautiful French text on his arm, which is in memory of his grandfather . And one of them is a depiction of depression and bipolar experiences.
	  
	  He had trouble in the way of doing his acolyte that he was surrounded by all these holy people and felt like a fraud.
	  
	  I shared with him an overview of how I saw him. A young man who is very gifted and sensitive to spiritual matters. A young man who is trying to find his way from childhood to adulthood. The artistic side of him is expressed in his elaborate tattoos of which he is proud.
