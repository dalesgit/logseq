## Reflection
### Who are Saints Perpetua and Felicity?

Saints Perpetua and Felicity, a young noblewoman and her slave, were martyred for their faith in A.D. 203, under the emperor Severus. At the time of their arrest, Perpetua had an infant son, and Felicity was pregnant. While she was in prison, Perpetua wrote about the circumstances leading up to their death in a diary that was later published as _The Passion of Saints Perpetua and Felicity_ – one of the earliest writings by a Christian woman.
