- There are multiple patterns as we follow the lessons through the year.
  
  I apologize for the fact that it's easier to notice these things for the people responsible for preaching week by week. But sometimes I have found that it's helpful to take a step back and look at the big picture.
  
  One of the things that I have found important, mostly since teaching young people about religion, is that Church Time is circular. It's not linear. We travel from Advent to Advent and begin the cycle all over again. 
  
  Most of you are aware that the lessons we follow on Sundays focuses on one of the 3 synoptic gospels each cycle. Matthew, Mark, and Luke. The gospel of John is interspersed throughout the 3 years. 
  
  In addition to the annual cycle there are smaller cycles within the year. The Epiphany cycle is like a small snapshot of Jesus' ministry, beginning with his baptism. It may be important that our own ministries within the church begin with our baptism. The Epiphany cycle looks at Jesus' call to ministry, his call of disciples, and culminates in a dramatic scene with 3 of his closest disciples on the mount of Transfiguration.
  
  Transfiguration is the point at which the 3 synoptic gospels pivot and focus on Jesus final journey to his Passion and Resurrection. Culminating in the Resurrection. That's the cycle we're in now. The cycle of Lent. 
  
  I imagine for myself multiple gyres, rotating at different rates and different directions. 1.  A circular or spiral motion or form, especially a circular ocean current. Like the Olympic logo only with different size circles. Or a map of the ocean currents around the world, circling between Asia and North America, New Zealand and South America, North Atlantic, Africa and South America, Australia and Pacific Islands, and Antarctica.

The Easter gyre, lasting 50 days until Pentecost, explores the meaning and implications of the Resurrection, for the disciples and followers of Jesus in the New Testament, and in the lives of Jesus' followers today – you and me.

Finally there is the gyre of all the weeks from Pentecost until the next Advent. During this season the fullness of life in Christ is explored, with multiple themes and multiple emphases, as the whole task of following Jesus was a cycle within a cycle with a cycle. 

My own experience is that being a disciple of Jesus is not like a once-off experience. The whole notion of experiencing conversion, and you're somehow all the way to home base, is a cockeyed way of thinking of life in Christ. 

My own experience is that each day I enter a new set of challenges to being a disciple of Christ. Each day a cycle within a cycle. Abram faced a new reality in the passage from Genesis we heard today. He was 99 years old and the LORD showed up at his doorstep and announced a covenant with him. His life changed with new requirements and – as a sign of the changed life – a new name.

The power of meeting these texts over and over again, at different moments in our life, with different circumstances, has to do with the day by day task we each of us face to make our lives conform with that of Jesus himself. 

So in Lent, the gyre we are following, is aimed squarely at the Passion of the Lord and the 3rd day reversal of the Resurrection. Lent, the cycle, pursues round and round, the implications of following Jesus to the cross. We hear Jesus tell us that directly in today's reading:

> If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake, and for the sake of the gospel, will save it.

Peter voices our initial resistance to doing such a thing. 

>  Jesus began to teach his disciples that the Son of Man must undergo great suffering, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.

But Peter says, "No. Please. No." What he recognizes, of course, is that there will be **suffering** along the way.
