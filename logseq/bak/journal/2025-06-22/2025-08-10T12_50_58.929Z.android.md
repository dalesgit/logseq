- TODO lunch with Larry Hooper
- 20:03 I called #Lydia before dinner. She called back in the midst of mine. Her voice still seemed upbeat. She reported that sometimes her job is boring. But it could be worse. She is planning next month to go to a dietitian to help her be "accountable" for what she is eating. They were at "the pool", which she called "x's" pool -- what is his name? With the youngest (5 y/o) whose named Ezra.
	- She called me on May 17 at 6:16 for 35 min.
- #people couple who were smiling at me both coming and going
	- Bill, tall one. Dave more rotund. Both affirmed how much they appreciated my preaching.
- TODO get an am/pm clock for diane
