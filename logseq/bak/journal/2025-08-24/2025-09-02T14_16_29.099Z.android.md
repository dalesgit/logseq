	- The office was recently contacted by a long-timer who pointed out that the following article provides a list of spiritual
	  **virtues**
	- (not principles) that originated from a plaque which was sold years ago and may originally came from a Grapevine article or other AA newsletter. It is known in the rooms of AA that the spiritual principles are the Twelve Steps. To be thorough, the 36 principles are the

	- Bill W. considered each step to be a spiritual principle in and of itself. However, particularly in the 12 & 12, he outlined the spiritual principles behind each step. Some of them seem like common sense, but understand going into the exercise that reading these principles and actually *practicing them in your day-to-day lives* are two entirely different things (and that the latter requires vigilance and willingness).
	- 1. **HONESTY** – Fairness and straight forwardness of conduct: adherence to the facts.
	  2. **HOPE** – To expect with desire; something on which hopes are centered.
	  3. **FAITH** – Complete confidence; belief and trust.
	  4. **COURAGE** – Firmness of mind and will in the face of extreme difficulty; mental or moral strength to withstand fear.
	  5. **INTEGRITY** – The quality or state of being complete or undivided; soundness.
	  6. **WILLINGNESS** – Prompt to act or respond; accepted and done of choice or without reluctance.
	  7. **HUMILITY** – Not proud or haughty; not arrogant or assertive; a clear and concise understanding of what we are, followed by a sincere desire to become what we can be.
	  8. **LOVE** – Unselfish concern that freely accepts another in loyalty and seeks his good to hold dear.
	  9. **DISCIPLINE** – Training that corrects, molds, or perfects the mental faculties or moral character; to bring under control; to train or develop by instruction.
	  10. **PATIENCE/PERSEVERANCE** – Steadfast despite opposition or adversity; able or willing to bear; to persist in an understanding in spite of counter influences.
	  11. **AWARENESS** – Alive and alert; vigilance in observing.
	  12. **SERVICE** – A helpful act; contribution to the welfare of others; useful labor that does not produce a tangible commodity.

	- The Episcopal priest Robert Farrar Capon has written beautifully about this hunger for hope. “To be sure, food keeps us alive,” he says in Supper of the Lamb, “but that is only its smallest and most temporary work. Its eternal purpose is to furnish our sensibilities against the day when we shall sit down at the heavenly banquet and see how gracious the Lord is. Nourishment is necessary only for a while; what we shall need forever is taste.” p. 164
