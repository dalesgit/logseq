  Where there is separation,
  there is pain.
  And where there is pain,
  there is story.
  
  And where there is story,
  there is understanding,
  and misunderstanding,
  listening
  and not listening.
  
  May we — separated peoples, estranged strangers,
  unfriended families, divided communities —
  turn toward each other,
  and turn toward our stories,
  with understanding
  and listening,
  with argument and acceptance,
  with challenge, change
  and consolation.
  
  Because if God is to be found,
  God will be found
  in the space
  between.
