  *You there. Stop what you’re doing. Take off that tool belt and hard hat—let’s see some ID. Why? Because we don’t think you’re a citizen. Now show us your papers.*

  Yesterday, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court allowed ICE officials to conduct roving patrols and use racial [profiling](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/08/us/politics/supreme-court-los-angeles-immigration.html) to stop and detain people for no other reason than their skin color, the language they’re speaking, suspicions about their national origin—or, really, if immigration officials just feel like it.
  
  *But wait*, you might object. *The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution prohibits unreasonable search and seizure. Did the Court explain why that protection apparently no longer applies to you if you’re a day laborer or running a* *fruit stand*\_?\_ Good luck with that: This Court’s majority [doesn’t explain itself](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/scotus-education-department/683536/) to anyone. It merely lets stand or overturns the decisions of lower courts—lately, almost always in favor of expanding the power of, and corroding any checks on, President Donald Trump.
