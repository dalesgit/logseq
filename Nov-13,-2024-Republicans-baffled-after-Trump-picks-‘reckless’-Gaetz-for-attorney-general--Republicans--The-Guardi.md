# Republicans baffled after Trump picks ‘reckless’ Gaetz for attorney general

Congressman decried as ‘person of moral turpitude’ amid questions over whether Senate will confirm nomination
 [Donald Trump’s](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)  decision to nominate the far-right Republican congressman  [Matt Gaetz](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/who-is-matt-gaetz)  as attorney general has sent shockwaves through Washington, including the president-elect’s own party.
 [Trump ](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/trump-matt-gaetz-attorney-general) on Wednesday announced Gaetz as his pick to be the nation’s chief law enforcement officer in the justice department, a role that directs the government’s legal positions on critical issues, including abortion, civil rights, and first amendment cases.
Republicans were puzzled over this nomination, expressing this move was not on their “bingo card”.
“I don’t think it’s a serious nomination for the attorney general,” Republican senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, told  [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-baffles-republican-senators-picking-matt-gaetz-attorney-general-rcna180048) . “We need to have a serious attorney general. And I’m looking forward to the opportunity to consider somebody that is serious. This one was not on my bingo card.”
A rightwing firebrand, Gaetz was a thorn in the side of his fellow Republican and former House speaker Kevin McCarthy, eventually leading the successful charge to  [oust](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/03/kevin-mccarthy-oust-republican-house-speaker-vote-result-matt-gaetz)  McCarthy from his role.
He was investigated by the justice department in a sex-trafficking case, though the department ultimately  [declined to bring charges](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/15/matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-case-closed-without-charges) . And was under investigation by the House ethics committee amid allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and other alleged ethical breaches.
Gaetz has fiercely denied wrongdoing.
Amid consternation even within his own party, it’s unclear if Gaetz can win Senate approval.
Republican congressman Max Miller of Ohio told  [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/13/matt-gaetz-republicans-trump-attorney-general)  that “Gaetz has a better shot at having dinner with Queen Elizabeth II than being confirmed by the Senate”.
Miller also told  [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/13/matt-gaetz-attorney-general-confirmation-doubt-00189382)  that Gaetz is “a reckless pick” with “a zero percent shot”.
John Bolton, a former national security adviser, said Gaetz “must be the worst nomination for a cabinet position in American history”.
“Gaetz is not only totally incompetent for this job, he doesn’t have the character. He is a person of moral turpitude,” Bolton said in an interview with  [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/matt-gaetz-must-be-the-worst-cabinet-nomination-in-american-history-amb-john-bolton-224379461670) .
One anonymous House GOP member told  [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/13/matt-gaetz-republicans-trump-attorney-general) : “We wanted him out of the House … this isn’t what we were thinking.” Another remarked they were “stunned and disgusted”.
Democrats, too, were left astonished by the announcement. Vice-President Kamala Harris’s team said in a statement that Trump and Gaetz “will weaponize the DoJ to protect themselves and their allies”.
Congressman Ro Khanna of California argued that voters were not necessarily voting for these cabinet picks when they decided to elect Trump.
“People voted for Trump to have lower prices and a secure border. I don’t think they voted for the appointments that they’re getting,” Khanna told  [CBS News](https://x.com/CBSNews/status/1856833480312984003) . “He is not moving to the center. He’s going to his Maga base, and we’ll see if he’s overreaching on the mandate he had from the American people.”
Kate Maeder, a California-based political strategist, said the announcement should not come as a surprise, but wondered whether Trump trusts Gaetz will make it through the confirmation process. “It’s not a surprise that Trump is rewarding his political loyalists,” Maeder told the Guardian. “It’s a shock to many that he’s considering Matt Gaetz for attorney general. But is this a serious pick? I don’t think so.”
“In this political climate, it’s definitely possible for Matt Gaetz to be confirmed,” she said. “But I think it’ll be difficult. Some of the more moderate Republican senators are already on record questioning this choice.”Explore more on these topics
