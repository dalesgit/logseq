Each chapter recommends additional films and includes discussion questions."Norris and Higgins add to a conversation that the filmmaker has begun and draw from their experience of life to give these humble films more depth. I wish there was more writing about films like it. I feel my perspective about the world widening through it."--Lee Isaac Chung, director of Minari and Twisters"Whether you're an avid movie watcher or hoping to dive into these films for the first time, please read this book and let it lead you into curiosity and wonder. You'll be so glad you did."--Kaitlin B. Curtice, award-winning author of Native, Living Resistance, and Winter's Gifts"With eyes and souls wide open, Norris and Higgins dare to believe movies can teach us how to live better, if only we'd allow them to. This book is a treasure."--Scott Teems, writer-director, Rectify, Narcos: Mexico, and The Quarry"Reading this beautiful book is like having an endlessly fascinating conversation with two friends about film, when those two friends are always wise, thoughtful, and funny and have inspiring things to say about the movies they love."--James Martin, SJ (from the foreword)
