	  A Texas UPS driver has a strong opinion on stay-at-home moms.
	  
	  J.R. Minton, a [33-year-old UPS driver](https://www.upworthy.com/tag/ups-drivers) from the [Dallas, Texas](https://www.upworthy.com/british-guy-shares-9-new-phrases-he-learned-in-texas), area, recently ruffled some feathers with a viral TikTok video titled â€œSAHMs Listen up!â€ that begins with him asking, â€œI mean, how entitled could you be?â€ At first, Minton appears to fail to appreciate the enormous amount of emotional, mental, and physical labor that [stay-at-home moms](https://www.upworthy.com/tag/stay-at-home-mom) provide.
	  
	  â€œI truly cannot imagine the amount of arrogance you must have to sit there and complain when you are so privileged to have a person who is willing to provide such a carefree life for you,â€ Minton continues. â€œLetâ€™s get real! What do you do all day? Your [spouse](https://www.upworthy.com/military-spouses-often-choose-their-spouses-career-over-their-own) is taking care of everything so you can take care of one thing. How complicated could it be: all you do is go to work?â€
	  
	  At this point, legions of stay-at-home mothers and those who love them considered trucking themselves to Dallas to find this unappreciative UPS driver. However, it was soon apparent that Minton was referring to himself.

	  Grow tf upâ€”You should be doing more. 
	  
	  â€œFor 10 hours a day, you get to live the life of a single, childless, carefree man because your wife was willing to take the financial risk of allowing you to be successful in your career while she takes care of everything else,â€ he continues. â€œShe provides childcare services, home cleaning services, medical services, food services, scheduling services, and a list that goes on and on. And you provide... a paycheck? And you have the nerve to call yourself the provider! What is it going to take for you to realize that, bro, everything you have in your life is because of a stay-at-home mom.â€
	  
	  The commenters on the video breathed sighs of relief and then praised Minton, a father of 4, for publicly appreciating his wifeâ€™s work.

	  "My sleeves were rolled up, earrings were off, hair tied up.... I was so ready...." one commenter joked. "I thought I landed in enemy territory for a min..." another added. "You have just made me realize after all these years that *I* am the freaking provider and that feels amazing,â€ a stay-at-home mother wrote.
	  
	  People appreciate Mintonâ€™s post because he praised stay-at-home mothers and placed his wifeâ€™s work above his, which he characterized as merely bringing home a paycheck. Minton has one job, delivering packages, but as he noted, his wife is an expert in over five different professions. In a world where stay-at-home moms are fighting to be seen as equals to their working spouses, Minton places them on a pedestal and owes his â€œcarefree lifeâ€ to them.
	  
	  "Married life, with children, is bound to be chaotic," Minton told Upworthy. "Itâ€™s bound to have its ups and downs; Itâ€™s made me question myself a thousand times. However, the marriage my wife and I share has given me the space to find peace."

	  Minton may be sharing an opinion we don't hear often enough, but he doesn't think he's the only one who thinks that way. "The last thing I am is rare or unique. Thereâ€™s nothing special about the way that I feel or the things that I say. I have the same thoughts, feelings, frustrations and problems that any other husband or father might be struggling with," he told Upworthy. "The only difference that might be apparent is how I choose to react to the same situations any other man might encounter."
	  
	  This post isnâ€™t the first time Minton has pulled the bait and switch on his followers. Last year, [he made a video](https://www.upworthy.com/man-refuses-to-help-wife-with-chores-ex1) where he appeared to take pride in the fact that he never â€œhelpsâ€ his wife with chores.
	  
	  The twist in this video was that he doesnâ€™t â€œhelpâ€ his wife with chores because they are also his responsibility. "Because I do what I am supposed to do as a father and a husband. I cook. I clean. I do the laundry. I take care of the kids. I can't help my wife do those things because they are my job, too,â€ he reveals.
	  
	  He then urged men to change their perspectives on how they view stay-at-home moms. â€œChange the way you speak, change the way you think, and grow the f*** up and be a man," he added.
	  
	  Minton is an equal partner to his wife because he wants to treat his wife and family differently from how he was raised. â€œPretty much everything about my parenting style is in spite of what I saw when I was growing up,â€ [he told Today.com.](https://www.today.com/parents/dads/man-goes-viral-saying-doesnt-help-wife-kids-chores-rcna120301?) It's wonderful to see someone like Minton breaking the generational cycles. What makes it even better is that he wants to teach others to do the same.
