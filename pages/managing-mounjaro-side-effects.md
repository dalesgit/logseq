	- Luckily, there are ways to manage side effects at home so they don’t interfere with your daily life too much. **Knowing how to manage Mounjaro side effects can help you get past them**, so you can continue with your treatment and reach your weight loss goals.
	  
	  ### Very common side effects
	  
	  #### Mounjaro diarrhoea
	  
	  **Diarrhoea can be treated by**:
	  
	  * drinking plenty of fluids (mainly water or electrolyte drinks like Diarolyte)
	  * avoiding spicy, rich, fatty, and greasy foods
	  * avoiding caffeine, pure fruit juices, or alcohol (these could have laxative effects)
	  * using over-the-counter medicine, such as loperamide – most people only need it for 1 or 2 days and you shouldn’t take it for longer than 48 hours without speaking to your doctor
	  * resting and not over-exerting yourself
	  
	  When you start to feel better, eat small portions of plain food and slowly introduce foods back if you don’t get more diarrhoea. Re-introducing food too quickly may upset your stomach, so take it slow. Just keep hydrated, as severe or long-lasting diarrhoea can cause dehydration. **If you get severe diarrhoea, speak to your doctor**.
	  
	  #### Mounjaro sickness
	  
	  This is a term used to cover Mounjaro nausea and Mounjaro vomiting, which are mainly treated the same way.
	  
	  **Nausea and vomiting can be treated by**:
	  
	  * drinking small amounts of fluid often (mainly water or electrolyte drinks)
	  * eating small, plain meals, if you can
	  * avoiding rich, fatty, or greasy foods
	  * avoiding caffeine, sugary drinks, or alcohol
	  * avoiding smoking, if you smoke, especially on an empty stomach
	  * getting fresh air
	  * resting
	  * distracting yourself when you feel nauseous to try and get your mind off of it, such as reading or watching your favourite TV show
	  * using over-the-counter or prescription medicines, such as anti-sickness tablets, after speaking with a pharmacist or doctor
	  * taking your Mounjaro dose with food, as this may alleviate some of the symptoms
	  
	  As with diarrhoea, introduce foods back slowly as you start to feel better. Severe vomiting can cause dehydration, so **speak to your doctor if you’re being sick frequently and can’t keep anything down**.
	  
	  #### Mounjaro constipation
	  
	  **Constipation can be treated by**:
	  
	  * eating little and often, so you aren’t putting too much into your stomach at once if you already feel uncomfortable
	  * eating a healthy, balanced diet
	  * avoiding alcohol
	  * choosing high-fibre foods or foods that may act as a natural laxative, such as broccoli, dried fruit, carrots or beans
	  * trying a stool softener or laxative which can be found over the counter
	  * doing stretches or other gentle exercises like walking
	  * trying to use a low stool while on the toilet, and if possible, raising your knees above your hips
	  
	  **If your constipation isn’t getting better with lifestyle changes and treatment, speak to your doctor**. Severe constipation (not being able to pass a stool for longer than 3 days) can be painful and you may need prescription laxatives or another medication to help.
	  
	  In rare cases, bowel obstruction could occur. This is a medical emergency and you should call 999 straight away. Symptoms include bloating, stomach pain, cramping, swelling, vomiting, difficulty passing gas, fever and loss of appetite.
	  
	  ### Common side effects
	  
	  #### Mounjaro burping
	  
	  **Burping can be treated by**:
	  
	  * not eating too quickly
	  * not using a straw or smoking, if you smoke (these can cause more air to enter your stomach)
	  * avoiding alcohol or fizzy drinks
	  * avoiding high-sugar, high-fat, or greasy foods
	  * drinking plenty of water
	  * trying mild to moderate exercise like walking, jogging, or yoga
	  * drinking herbal teas, such as peppermint
	  * taking Mounjaro with food
	  * using an over-the-counter remedy for indigestion, as this could be causing the gas in your stomach
	  
	  Burping a lot on Mounjaro could be a sign of indigestion, heartburn, or acid reflux. **If it keeps happening, speak to your pharmacist or doctor** about a treatment for reflux that can be taken alongside Mounjaro. It may also help to keep a food diary, so you can see if any foods worsen your symptoms.
	  
	  #### Mounjaro heartburn or reflux
	  
	  **Heartburn or reflux (GORD) can be treated by**:
	  
	  * eating small, more frequent meals
	  * avoiding foods and drinks that trigger your symptoms, which may include caffeine, alcohol, and spicy, fatty, acidic, or greasy foods
	  * sleeping with your head slightly raised (to stop acid travelling back up)
	  * avoiding laying down after eating or eating close to bedtime
	  * eating your food slowly and chewing thoroughly
	  * wearing comfortable, loose clothes
	  * stopping smoking, if you smoke
	  * trying an over-the-counter acid reflux or heartburn medication
	  
	  **If your symptoms don’t get better and you’re taking over-the-counter medication every day, speak with your doctor**. They may prescribe a different treatment that could help more.
	  
	  #### Mounjaro tiredness
	  
	  Mounjaro may cause tiredness by itself, or other side effects may make you feel tired, especially if they’re preventing you from getting quality sleep.
	  
	  **Tiredness can be treated by**:
	  
	  * maintaining a healthy, balanced diet with plenty of nutrients
	  * taking multivitamins if you’re not getting all the nutrients you need from your diet and are deficient
	  * staying hydrated
	  * getting regular exercise – even though it’s hard to exercise when you feel tired, do what you can, as exercising can improve your energy levels
	  * maintaining a good sleep schedule (at least 8 hours each night)
	  * cutting down on screen time close to bed
	  * limiting caffeine intake, especially after midday
	  * avoiding alcohol
	  * getting plenty of rest in the day if you’re feeling run down, especially if you have other side effects
	  
	  **If you keep feeling tired on Mounjaro, speak with your doctor**. They may want to check this isn’t caused by a lack of certain vitamins or minerals, such as Vitamin D or iron.
	  
	  You can also feel tired when eating less, exercising more, and changing your diet, so being tired could be caused by these lifestyle changes.
	  
	  #### Mounjaro dizziness
	  
	  **Dizziness can be treated by**:
	  
	  * drinking plenty of fluids
	  * lying down until it passes, then getting up carefully and slowly
	  * avoiding driving or using heavy machinery if you feel dizzy to prevent accidents
	  * getting enough rest
	  * avoiding stressful situations and finding ways to reduce your stress levels, as this could be contributing to your dizziness
	  * taking Mounjaro after food and drink, especially if you get dizzy right after your injection
	  
	  Mounjaro is most likely to cause dizziness if your blood sugar levels are low (hypoglycaemia), although you can get dizziness as a side effect with normal blood sugar levels. If you get dizziness when taking Mounjaro, especially if you have other symptoms like headache, weakness, or irritability, speak with your doctor so they can check your levels. **People with type 2 diabetes should take special care**, as Mounjaro can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia if taken with insulin.
	  
	  #### Mounjaro stomach pain
	  
	  **Stomach pain can be treated by**:
	  
	  * eating a balanced, healthy diet
	  * avoiding foods that could be triggering, such as oily, greasy, acidic, spicy, or rich meals
	  * eating little and often, instead of eating a lot at once
	  * using a hot water bottle or painkillers to help with the pain
	  * speaking with a pharmacist about other treatments that may help, as stomach pain could be caused by nausea or acid reflux
	  
	  Stomach pain shouldn’t last long with Mounjaro and could be caused by other side effects. If you get severe stomach pain that isn’t going away, it could be a sign of something more serious, such as pancreatitis. **Speak with your GP, call 111, or go to A\&E if your stomach pain is severe and long-lasting**.
	  
	  #### Mounjaro injection site reaction
	  
	  **Injection site reactions can be treated by**:
	  
	  * using an antihistamine if the site feels itchy (a tablet or cream)
	  * switching up your injection site each week – either use the other side of the body or make sure you use a different area of skin each time
	  * making sure the area is fully clean before injecting
	  * always using a new, unbent needle
	  * using an ice pack to numb the site before injecting to reduce any pain, or afterwards to reduce inflammation
	  
	  **If following these instructions doesn’t help, or the reactions are severe, speak with your doctor**.
