- There is no art in this White House. There is no literature or 
  poetry in this White House. No music. No Kennedy Center 
  award celebrations. There are no pets in this White House. No 
  loyal man's best friend. No Socks the family cat. No kids' 
  science fairs. No times when this president takes off his blue 
  suit-red tie uniform and becomes human, except when he puts
  on his white shirt - khaki pants uniform and hides from 
  Americans to play golf. There are no images of the first family 
  enjoying themselves together in a moment of relaxation. No 
  Obamas on the beach in Hawaii moments, or Bushes fishing in 
  Kennebunkport, no Reagans on horseback, no Kennedys 
  playing touch football on the Cape.
- I was thinking the other 
  day of the summer when George H couldn't catch a fish and all 
  the grand kids made signs and counted the fish-less days. And 
  somehow, even if you didn't even like GHB, you got caught up 
  in the joy of a family that loved each other and had fain. Where 
  did that country go? Where did all of the fun and joy and 
  expressions of love and happiness go? We used to be a country 
  that did the ice bucket challenge and raised millions for charity. 
  We used to have a president that calmed and soothed the nation 
  instead of dividing it. A First Lady that planted a garden 
  instead of ripping one out. We are rudderless and joyless. We 
  have lost the cultural aspects of society that make America 
  great. We have lost our mojo. Our fun, our happiness. The 
  cheering on of others. The shared experiences of humanity that 
  makes it all worth it. The challenges that we shared and 
  celebrated. The unique can-do spirit Americans have always 
  been known for. We have lost so much in so short a time.
