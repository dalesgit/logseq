- In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's mind there are few.
	- Before a person studies Zen, mountains are mountains and waters are waters; after a first glimpse into the truth of Zen, mountains are no longer mountains and waters are not waters; after enlightenment, mountains are once again mountains and waters once again waters.

- The thing about Zen is that it pushes
- contradictions to their ultimate limit where one has to choose between madness and innocence.
- And Zen suggests that we may be driving toward one or the other on a cosmic scale. Driving toward them because, one way or the other, as madmen or innocents, we are already there.

- Simple free being becomes encrusted with the burdensome armor of the ego. Not until years later does an instinct come that a vital sense of mystery has been withdrawn. The sun glints through the pines, and the heart is pierced in a moment of beauty and strange pain, like a memory of paradise. After that day... we become seekers.

- One day a man approached Ikkyu and asked:
- "Master, will you please write for me some maxims of the highest wisdom?"
- Ikkyu took his brush and wrote: "Attention."
- "Is that all?" asked the man.
- Ikkyu then wrote: "Attention. Attention."
- "Well," said the man, "I really don't see much
- depth in what you have written."
- Then Ikkyu wrote the same word three times:
- "Attention. Attention. Attention""
- Half-angered, the man demanded: "What does
- that word 'Attention' mean, anyway?"
- Ikkyu gently responded, "Attention means
- attention."

- I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or particle of God.
	- Emerson
- The nature of God is a circle of which the center is everywhere and the circumference is nowhere.
