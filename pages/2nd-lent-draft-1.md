- There are multiple patterns as we follow the lessons through the year.
  
  I apologize for the fact that it's easier to notice these things for the people responsible for preaching week by week. But sometimes I have found that it's helpful to take a step back and look at the big picture.
  
  One of the things that I have found important, mostly since teaching young people about religion, is that Church Time is circular. It's not linear. We travel from Advent to Advent and begin the cycle all over again. 
  
  Most of you are aware that the lessons we follow on Sundays focuses on one of the 3 synoptic gospels each cycle. Matthew, Mark, and Luke. The gospel of John is interspersed throughout the 3 years. 
  
  In addition to the annual cycle there are smaller cycles within the year. The Epiphany cycle is like a small snapshot of Jesus' ministry, beginning with his baptism. It may be important that our own ministries within the church begin with our baptism. The Epiphany cycle looks at Jesus' call to ministry, his call of disciples, and culminates in a dramatic scene with 3 of his closest disciples on the mount of Transfiguration.
  
  Transfiguration is the point at which the 3 synoptic gospels pivot and focus on Jesus final journey to his Passion and Resurrection. Culminating in the Resurrection. That's the cycle we're in now. The cycle of Lent. 
  
  I imagine for myself multiple gyres, rotating at different rates and different directions. 1.  A circular or spiral motion or form, especially a circular ocean current. Like the Olympic logo only with different size circles.
