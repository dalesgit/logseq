	- Having regular bowel movements not only keeps your tummy happy, it’s also good for your health. But about 16% of American adults suffer from constipation, an uncomfortable and sometimes painful condition. Two nutrients often recommended for relief are magnesium and fiber, but which should you try first?
	- Gastroenterologists agree both fiber and magnesium can help, though results vary by person. Fiber is essential—especially if bowel habits fluctuate—and should be the first step. Magnesium may also support regularity, and the two can be used safely together. The consensus: start with fiber from food, then consider magnesium or supplements if relief is still needed.
	- There are two types of fiber: [soluble and insoluble](https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/). Soluble fiber absorbs water and forms a gel as it passes through the digestive tract, making it easier to poop. Insoluble fiber does not absorb water, but rather, adds bulk to the stool and makes it easier to pass.
	- Health and nutrition experts recommend eating 28 to 34 grams of fiber per day. However, there are no set recommendations for the amount of insoluble and soluble fiber you should have each day. Eating plenty of plant foods, such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, beans, peas and whole grains, will provide a mix of fibers that can help keep you healthy—and regular.
	- Fiber is supposed to ease digestive woes, but it can also cause some GI issues. “The most common side effect of fiber supplementation is gas and bloating, but not everyone will experience this,” says [Brisas Truncali, M.D](https://www.connecticutgi.org/brisas-truncali/). One thing that will help as you increase fiber intake is to [drink plenty of water](https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7825445/how-much-water-should-you-drink-by-the-numbers/), she says. To boost your fiber intake, focus on increasing your food sources of fiber before starting a [fiber supplement](https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fiber-supplements-8548491).
	- Magnesium is a mineral present in many foods. In the body, magnesium plays a role in protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, blood pressure regulation, energy production, bone development, DNA synthesis, nerve function, muscle contraction and normal heart rhythm. If that seems like a lot, it’s because magnesium is involved in hundreds of reactions in the body. In other words, magnesium is important for many bodily processes, including helping you poop.
	- “Magnesium, particularly in forms like magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide, works by drawing water into the intestines, which softens the stool and stimulates bowel movements,” says Clarke.
	- In addition, magnesium relaxes the digestive muscles, which can also help promote bowel movements, says [Harold G. Tepler, M.D](https://gastrospecialistsnj.com/physicians/harold-g-tepler-md/).
	- Magnesium is a recommended daily mineral, which is safe for healthy individuals. However, “if someone has a heart condition or kidney disease, they should speak with their providers before starting a magnesium supplement of any kind,” adds Truncali.
	- Although magnesium supplements can act as a natural laxative for chronic constipation, says Tepler, using magnesium for extended periods of time for this purpose can cause side effects, such as dehydration, nutritional deficits and weight loss.
	- All three doctors agree that both magnesium and fiber can relieve constipation, but it is difficult to know what will be effective for whom and to what degree. “Fiber should never be ignored, especially if you experience a constant fluctuation in your bowel movements,” says Tepler.
	- “Magnesium and fiber are safe to use together and may cause a more robust response than each on its own, but one does not make the other more effective,” says Truncali. Start with boosting your fiber intake via food then move on to a possible magnesium and/or fiber supplementation if you do not experience relief.
	- If your efforts don’t bring relief, reach out to a healthcare provider. They can [look for underlying causes](https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8061979/reasons-constipated-not-food-according-to-a-dietitian/)—like medications or medical conditions—and help create a treatment plan.
	- Many [lifestyle factors contribute to regular bowel movements](https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8043646/normal-reasons-youre-pooping-a-lot/), such as hydration, exercise and stress management, so it may be worth reevaluating how your overall lifestyle might be contributing to your regularity. Find ways to de-stress, change up your hydration with [lemon, cucumber and mint infused water](https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265887/lemon-cucumber-mint-infused-water/) and consider how you might enjoy some movement throughout the day. To increase your intake of important nutrients—including magnesium and fiber—focus on simple recipes with plenty of plant-based ingredients, such as smoothies, soups, salads and casseroles.
	- Both fiber and magnesium are important nutrients for digestive and overall health. Focusing on consuming fiber or magnesium may help alleviate constipation, and you may want to try boosting your intake of fiber-containing foods first, then add a magnesium and/or fiber supplement if needed. Still, gastroenterologists agree supplementation recommendations depend on the person and their unique case. Speak with a health care provider to figure out if you should use any kind of magnesium or fiber supplementation for constipation.
