- [[Abstract]]
	- "Looks at a life in activism, politics, and ministry to reveal four key discernable movements of a lifelong soul journey to God's justice"-- Provided by publisher.
- Hereâ€™s a true story from the Buddhist tradition that might illustrate this. In Bangkok, Thailand, there was huge clay statue of the Buddha. In the 1950s a combination of heat and drought caused it to begin to crack. Monks came to examine the damage. They looked at the largest crack, and then shone a flashlight on it. To their surprise, through the crack they spotted a reflection of gold. It turned out that a solid gold Buddha was embedded beneath the clay. Six-hundred years earlier layers of protective clay and plaster were used to cover up the gold Buddha and protect it from invading armies. The monks were killed, but the Buddha survived. Yet over time its identity was defined by its layers of protective covering, while its true nature was hidden from all. @granberg-michaelsonSoulworkJusticeFour2025 p. 23
