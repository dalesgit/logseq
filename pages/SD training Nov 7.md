			- A spiritual crisis results when the circumstances of our lives shift so drastically that all we understand about God, our world, and ourselves may celebrate with them, we cannot help but feel some degree of loss. Our role in their lives has begun to change. Meanwhile, we may realize that we are not going to be of accomplish everything we thought we would when we were younger (Roussell, p. 22; Rupp, p. 102). We begin to think about the people we have hurt or disappointed, and we recall the ways in which others have wounded us or let us down (Rupp, p. 102). We have regrets and wish it could have been different, but we know we cannotgo back and change things. We realize chat nothing is perfect, at least according to the standards we have counted on for so long. Faith communities sometimes gossip and are unsupportive; spiritual leaders betray our trust, manipulating for power and control. We realize that our idealized visions of how things ought co be do not always represent how they really are (Roussell, p. 22). As we grow older, we notice that, in addition to being a little wiser, we are also a litle slower. We may count ourselves fortunate if the only things that inconvenience us are a sore back in the morning and vision and hearing that may not be quite what they used to be (Roussell, p. 22; Rupp, p. 102). All of these things represent losses chat we grieve on some level, whether we are aware of it or not. For some of us, however, the losses we suffer are anything but subde. Caraclysmic, they bring with them a tidal wave of grief char chreatens to drown us with its magnitude. The loss of our lifelong beloved, a precious child, a career, our health—anything that defined our world, gave us identity, meaning, and purpose—all Jead us into the blackest, most profound depths of grief. These losses ravage us, They cause us co question the image of God that we have held all our lives. Early in life, we hear that God is love. We encounter images of the Divine as guiding, protecting, nurturing, and willing to offer the most profound personal sacrifice to ensure our eternal joy and well-being.
