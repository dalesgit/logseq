			- A spiritual crisis results when the circumstances of our lives shift so drastically that all we understand about God, our world, and ourselves ...
			- We have regrets and wish it could have been different, but we know we cannotgo back and change things. We realize chat nothing is perfect, at least according to the standards we have counted on for so long. Faith communities sometimes gossip and are unsupportive; spiritual leaders betray our trust, manipulating for power and control.
			- Were We Wrong about God?
			- What could we possibly have done to deserve such pain and loss?

			- 1. God sends the loss and pain since [God] loves us and wants to strengthen our faith.
			- 2. God sends pain to punish us for some sin we have committed.
			- 3. God sends suffering to test our fidelity and to prove that we love God no matter what.

			- According to the Spiritual Directors International Web site (www.sdiworld. org), spiritual direction is far more about companionship, guidance, and mentoring than it is about giving direction. Spiritual direction is a relationship of trust between one who guides others on their spiritual journeys and another who longs to deepen the connection with God and to discern the movement of God in her or his life.
			- when I could no longer rely on myself o¢ on my old, limiting understandings of God—when I was completely empty of any imagery or belief at all—something new emerged. This time the second bar was clearly God's willingness to meet me at the point of my complete surrender— in the very heart of my vulnerability. This new experience of God became my strength, allowing me to crust that this loving Presence would carry me forward. Even though I would not be free of the pain and fear that are a part of human experience, God would not permit me to fall

			- In a dark night of the soul, alchough we are suffering an apparent loss and are grieving, we are probably not angry with God. We continue to long for an experience of the Divine Presence
				- dark night: longstanding practice; we can think of nothing but God; **apparent**  loss is really a **gain**
			- we realize chat we really would not change things, even if we could.

However, even with sudden or traumatic losses, some tend to focus on the aspects of a loss experience that provides buoyancy. Doing so does not indicate that theyare not fully engaged in the grieving process.
