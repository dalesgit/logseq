	- "As an American: The fact that a private company and a for-profit business can own something as essential as electricity. And they’re allowed to have a complete monopoly so they just charge whatever the hell they want. This shouldn’t be a thing. Electricity should be part of your city’s public utilities. It shouldn’t be something that you can trade in the stock market. The prescription drug ads. These should not exist. If one needs a doctor to approve it, why are you promoting it to us on TV? We can’t just go buy it or tell the doctor what to prescribe. The culture of your work is what defines you, and the idea that if you’re not getting by, you’re just not trying hard enough. No. Hard work doesn’t always pay off, and people shouldn’t have to work themselves to death just to afford rent."
