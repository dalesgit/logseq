	- ### 4.7. Download Videos in Specific Quality and Format 
	  
	  By default, yt-dlp will download videos in the best available quality if you don't pass any options. However, you have the flexibility to download a video or playlist in a specific quality or format as per your preferences.
	  
	  YouTube offers the following quality options for video downloads:
	- **best:** This selects the highest quality format available, including both video and audio.
	- **worst:** It picks the lowest quality format for both video and audio.
	- **bestvideo:** This option selects the best quality video-only format (e.g., DASH video).
	- **worstvideo:** Similar to bestvideo but chooses the lowest quality video-only format.
	- **bestaudio:** This selects the best quality audio-only format.
	- **worstaudio:** Similar to bestaudio but chooses the lowest quality audio-only format.
	  
	  For example, if you want to download the video in the best available quality for both audio and video, use this command:
	  
	  ```
	  yt-dlp -f best https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5b20oLaIaw
	  ```
- getting apk (adp) up and running
	- To install APK files on a Chromebook without enabling developer mode, you need to ==utilize the Linux environment and ADB (Android Debug Bridge)==. This involves enabling the Linux (Beta) feature in your Chromebook's settings and then enabling ADB debugging within the Linux environment. After that, you can download APK files, move them to the Linux files area, and install them using the terminal. 
	  
	  Here's a more detailed breakdown:
	- **Enable Linux (Beta):** Go to Settings > Advanced > Developers and enable Linux (Beta).
	- **Enable ADB Debugging:** Within the Linux settings, find the option for Android Development and enable it. You may need to restart your Chromebook.
	- **Install ADB:** Open the Linux terminal and install the necessary tools using the command: `sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb`.
	- **Download APK:** Download the desired APK file from a trusted source.
	- **Move to Linux Files:** Copy or move the downloaded APK file into the Linux files area (accessible through the Files app).
	- **Install via Terminal:** Open the Linux terminal and use the command `adb install <file_name.apk>` to install the app.
	- **Launch the App:** After successful installation, the app should appear in your Chrome OS launcher. 
	  
	  Important Considerations:
	- **Trusted Sources:**
	  
	  It's crucial to download APK files from reputable sources to minimize the risk of malware.
	- **Security:**
	  
	  Sideloading APKs can pose security risks, so exercise caution and only install from trusted sources.
	- **Error Handling:**
	  
	  If you encounter errors during installation, double-check the file path and ensure ADB debugging is correctly enabled.
	- **Alternative Testing:**
	  
	  If you need to test APK files without installing them on your Chromebook, consider using a service like [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/open-apk-files-chromebook).
