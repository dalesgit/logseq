- satisfaction today
	- refined the scripts for:
		- 2audio [^1]
		- Nice quick way to see disk usage in Crostini: (by excluding the mnt folder)
			- ```ncdu / --exclude mnt```
		- alias for: helium (h), easy tag (in menu), tmux (t)
	- [^1]: I like the color and added information from the wiki-sub script
