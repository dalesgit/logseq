	- ### 4.7. Download Videos in Specific Quality and Format 
	  
	  By default, yt-dlp will download videos in the best available quality if you don't pass any options. However, you have the flexibility to download a video or playlist in a specific quality or format as per your preferences.
	  
	  YouTube offers the following quality options for video downloads:
	- **best:** This selects the highest quality format available, including both video and audio.
	- **worst:** It picks the lowest quality format for both video and audio.
	- **bestvideo:** This option selects the best quality video-only format (e.g., DASH video).
	- **worstvideo:** Similar to bestvideo but chooses the lowest quality video-only format.
	- **bestaudio:** This selects the best quality audio-only format.
	- **worstaudio:** Similar to bestaudio but chooses the lowest quality audio-only format.
	  
	  For example, if you want to download the video in the best available quality for both audio and video, use this command:
	  
	  ```
	  yt-dlp -f best https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5b20oLaIaw
	  ```
