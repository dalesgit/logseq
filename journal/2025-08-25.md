  ## How to Install Grocy on [Arch Linux](https://www.ipv6.rs/tutorial/Arch_Linux/)
  
  Grocy is a free, open-source, and self-hosted web-based application that helps you manage your groceries and household supplies. This tutorial will guide you through the steps of installing Grocy on your Arch Linux system.
  
  ## Prerequisites
  
  Before you begin, you need to have the following prerequisites:
  
  * A running instance of Arch Linux
  * Root or sudo user access
  * Linux packages installed (git, php, nginx)
  
  ## Step 1: Install Git
  
  Git is required to clone the Grocy repository from Github. Run the following command to install Git:
  
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S git
  ```
  
  ## Step 2: Install Nginx
  
  Nginx is a web server used to host the Grocy application. Run the following command to install Nginx:
  
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S nginx
  ```
  
  ## Step 3: Install PHP
  
  Grocy is built using PHP. The following command will install PHP and some commonly used PHP extensions:
  
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S php php-fpm php-gd php-intl php-pdo php-sqlite php-mysql
  ```
  
  ## Step 4: Clone the Grocy Repository
  
  Now clone the Grocy repository from Github using the following command:
  
  ```bash
  sudo git clone https://github.com/grocy/grocy /srv/http/grocy
  ```
  
  ## Step 5: Configure Nginx
  
  Create a new Nginx configuration file for Grocy:
  
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/grocy.conf
  ```
  
  Add the following content into the file:
  
  ```
  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name example.com;
      root /srv/http/grocy/public;
      index index.php;
      location / {
          try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
      }
      location ~ \.php$ {
          fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock;
          fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
          fastcgi_index index.php;
          include fastcgi_params;
      }
  }
  ```
  
  Save and close the file.
  
  ## Step 6: Start Nginx and PHP-FPM
  
  Now start the Nginx and PHP-FPM services:
  
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable nginx
  sudo systemctl start nginx
  sudo systemctl enable php-fpm
  sudo systemctl start php-fpm
  ```
  
  ## Step 7: Configure the Database
  
  Grocy requires a database to store its data. You can use either MySQL or SQLite.
  
  ### Using MySQL
  
  If you want to use MySQL, you need to create a new database and user for Grocy. Run the following commands to create a new database and user:
  
  ```bash
  mysql -u root -p
  CREATE DATABASE grocy;
  CREATE USER 'grocy'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON grocy.* TO 'grocy'@'localhost';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  exit;
  ```
  
  ### Using SQLite
  
  If you want to use SQLite, you need to create a new SQLite database file:
  
  ```bash
  sudo touch /srv/http/grocy/data/grocy.db
  sudo chown http:http /srv/http/grocy/data/grocy.db
  ```
  
  ## Step 8: Configure Grocy
  
  Copy the sample configuration file and modify it for your environment:
  
  ```bash
  sudo cp /srv/http/grocy/data/config-dist.php /srv/http/grocy/data/config.php
  sudo nano /srv/http/grocy/data/config.php
  ```
  
  Set the database connection settings according to your chosen database:
  
  ```php
  // MySQL settings
  define('GROCY_DB_CONNECTION_STRING', 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=grocy');
  define('GROCY_DB_USERNAME', 'grocy');
  define('GROCY_DB_PASSWORD', 'password');
  
  // SQLite settings
  define('GROCY_DB_CONNECTION_STRING', 'sqlite:/srv/http/grocy/data/grocy.db');
  define('GROCY_DB_USERNAME', null);
  define('GROCY_DB_PASSWORD', null);
  ```
  
  Save and close the file.
  
  ## Step 9: Open Grocy in Your Browser
  
  Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost](http://localhost/). You should see the Grocy homepage.
  
  Congratulations, you have successfully installed Grocy on Arch Linux!
