	- The archbishop of Canterbury has resigned after an investigation found that he failed to pursue an investigation into allegations of serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer associated with the Church of England at Christian summer camps.
	- Justin Welby, 68, resigned on Tuesday, five days after the independent Makin Report singled him out for criticism over his handling of abuse allegations dating back to the 1970s.
	- Here is what you need to know:
	- ## Who is Justin Welby, and why did he resign?
	- Welby announced his resignation “in sorrow”, taking “personal and institutional responsibility” for a lack of action on the “heinous abuses” allegedly committed by the late John Smyth, a volunteer at Christian summer camps decades ago.
	- “The last few days have renewed my long felt and profound sense of shame at the historic safeguarding failures of the Church of England,” Welby said.
	- Educated at Britain’s most prestigious private school, Eton, Welby worked in the oil industry for more than a decade before being ordained in 1992. He was made the senior prelate of the Church of England in 2013.

	- [Welby](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/12/justin-welby-resigns-as-archbishop-of-canterbury-over-abuse-scandal) was an outspoken spiritual leader of the global Anglican community who grappled publicly with issues ranging from same-sex marriage to Britain’s immigration policy, Israel’s war in Gaza, slavery reparations, climate change and his own mental health problems.

	- ## Who was John Smyth, and what was he accused of?
	- Smyth was an evangelical, Canadian-born, British barrister who held leadership roles in a charity called the Iwerne Trust, which ran Christian camps in England and Wales.
	- Initial details of Smyth’s physical abuse of schoolboys who had attended the camps during the 1970s and 1980s emerged in a 1982 report by the charity.
	- Smyth was reported to have brought pupils from prestigious public schools in England, including Winchester College, to his home, where he lashed them with a cane in his shed.
	- The case was not reported to the police by the trust, the church or the schools whose pupils were subjected to abuse.
	- Instead, Smyth moved to Zimbabwe, where he set up the Zambesi Ministries, which ran similar Christian camps for schoolboys.
	- In 1992 after facing charges of killing a teenage boy who was found dead in a swimming pool, Smyth moved to Cape Town, South Africa.
	- In 2013, a victim reported abuse by Smyth to the [Church of England](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/11/church-of-england-says-it-knew-of-slavery-links), which in turn reported the allegations to the police, but an investigation was not initiated.
	- The 1982 Iwerne Trust report was made public in 2016, prompting an investigation by Channel 4 News in 2017.
	- Smyth died the next year in Cape Town at the age of 77.
	- In total, he has been held responsible for the violent abuse of at least 115 children and young men in England, Zimbabwe and South Africa.
	- The report said Smyth had subjected boys and young men to “brutal and horrific” physical and sexual abuse over a 40-year period.
	- Smyth beat some victims with up to 800 strokes of a cane and supplied nappies to absorb the bleeding, the report said.
	- He would then drape himself over his victims, sometimes kissing them on the neck or back.
	- Welby said he had “no idea or suspicion” of the allegations before 2013, but the independent report concluded it was unlikely he would have had no knowledge of the concerns regarding Smyth in the 1980s.
	- ## Who could succeed Welby?
	- Under the church’s rules, the Crown Nominations Commission (CNC) is a body of clerics that manages the choice of Welby’s successor.
	- It submits the name of a preferred and an alternative candidate to the United Kingdom’s prime minister, who then advises the monarch on the appointment.
	- It is too early to tell who the CNC will select as Welby’s successor, but there are some likely candidates.
	- Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York and the second most senior bishop of the Church of England, will be in the running.
	- Cottrell released a statement after Welby’s resignation, saying it was “the right and honourable thing to do”.
	- A former chief nursing officer in the Department of Health and current bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, could also be in the running. She is the third most senior bishop in the Church of England.

	- The bishop of Newcastle, Helen-Ann Hartley, has been vocal in calling for Welby to step down, which could make her a possible candidate as the Church of England looks to distance itself from the scandal.
	- She has also recently come out as saying she has experienced “coercive language” from Welby and Cottrell in the past.
	- Martyn Snow, the bishop of Leicester; Graham Usher, the bishop of Norwich; and Guli Francis-Dehqani, the bishop of Chelmsford, have all also been tipped to succeed Welby.
	- Snow abstained in a church assembly vote on blessings for gay couples while Usher is in favour of gay rights.
	- Francis-Dehqani was born in Iran and has spoken about how her brother was killed in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution.
	- If a woman is chosen archbishop of Canterbury, she would be the first to occupy the post.
	- ## Has the church faced other abuse allegations in the past?
	- Welby’s resignation comes against the backdrop of widespread historical sexual abuse in the Church of England.
	- A 2022 report by the Independent Inquiry Child Sexual Abuse found that deference to the authority of priests, taboos surrounding the discussion of sexuality and a culture that gave more support to alleged perpetrators than their victims helped make the Church of England “a place where abusers could hide”.

	- [Boomers were born between 1946 and 1964](https://libguides.usc.edu/busdem/age), making them between the ages of 60 and 78 years old. Boomers often have a less-than-stellar reputation, as younger generations see them as out-of-touch old people holding onto an outdated lifestyle while complaining endlessly about how things were better back in their day. Yet many boomer habits people make fun of are actually good for you.
	- Boomers weren't born into the digital age, which means they grew up in a slower paced world. Boomers would never have believed that someday we'd all walk around with phones in our pockets, let alone phones that were also computers that could connect people in an instant.
	- Technological advances make certain aspects of life easier, but the drawbacks shouldn't be ignored either. Leaning into a boomer lifestyle and adopting some of their habits can be beneficial for everyone, no matter how old you are.
	- ## Here are 10 boomer habits people make fun of that are actually good for you
	- ### 1. Eating dinner at the table
	- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-dinner-at-table.png){:width 675 :height 380} Monkey Business Images | Shutterstock
	- Boomers might get dragged for eating dinner at 5:30 in the evening and not tipping their servers, yet it turns out that one part of their mealtime routine is actually very good for you: eating dinner at the table, without the distraction of screens.
	- Putting their phones away and eating at the table gives people built-in time to decompress and reconnect. [Intuitive eating counselor Lisa Newman explained](https://www.yourtango.com/family/signs-child-needs-family-dinners) that having a shared family meal leads to healthier eating patterns, along with less family stress and stronger bonds between family members.
	- She acknowledged that it can be super tempting for parents of younger children to pop their kids in front of a screen so they can eat a meal in relative peace and quiet, yet restricting screens around meals teaches kids many essential life skills, like mindful eating, proper manners, and how to have an actual conversation.
	- [Going screen-free for every meal](https://www.yourtango.com/self/parenting-coach-shares-3-step-method-getting-kids-off-screens) might not be possible, yet aiming for one night a week where phones disappear and everyone eats together at the table can be seriously beneficial for the whole family.

	- ### 2. Going to bed early
	- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-sleep-early.png){:width 675 :height 380} PeopleImages.com - Yuri A. | Shutterstock
	- Another boomer habit people make fun of that's actually good for you is going to bed early. Getting a good night's sleep is often easier said than done, yet as [one public health study](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/17/10740) from the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health revealed, a large portion of people's sleep disturbances have to do with technology.
	- The study noted that taking our phones to bed and being chronically online makes it harder to disconnect and turn our brains off to get the rest we desperately need. Americans today sleep less than 7.5 hours a night on average, which is a major decrease from the amount of sleep people used to get. In 1910, Americans slept for an estimated average of 9 hours a night.
	- Low-quality sleep [can negatively impact people's mental and physical health](https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/things-that-happen-when-you-dont-get-enough-sleep), which means that making fun of boomers for tucking in early doesn't make much sense. If younger generations followed in their footsteps and went to bed earlier, it's highly likely they'd feel significantly better than they do now, doom-scrolling until dawn.
	- ### 3. Drinking coffee every morning
	- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-coffee.png){:width 675 :height 380} Ground Picture | Shutterstock
	- The older people get, the more tied to their routines they become, but in the case of morning coffee, that's a good thing. [Nutrition experts at Johns Hopkins University revealed](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/9-reasons-why-the-right-amount-of-coffee-is-good-for-you) that drinking coffee isn't as bad of a habit as people think it is, since coffee has antioxidants and other substances that reduce internal inflammation and protect people from disease. Coffee consumption might even put a stop to certain conditions that are more common for women, including heart disease and Alzheimer's disease.
	- The nutrition experts noted that drinking one to two cups of coffee a day can protect against heart failure and stroke. Drinking coffee can protect your liver and help your body process sugar better. Health benefits aside, [having a morning ritual](https://www.yourtango.com/self/morning-habits-give-you-unfair-advantage-rest-of-day) can keep people feeling balanced and ready to take on the day, which is something everyone needs more of.
	- ### 4. Calling instead of texting
	- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-phone-call.png){:width 675 :height 380} Ground Picture | Shutterstock
	- Boomers might get made fun of for their communication style, like sending an email, then sending a follow-up text to make sure you got their email, then using the phone in a way Steve Jobs never intended and calling, to tell you they sent you a text. Yet it turns out that calling instead of texting is actually good for you.
	- Despite how connected we are to the digital world, [we live in a lonelier era than ever before](https://www.yourtango.com/self/four-reasons-americans-lonelier-than-people-other-countries). The ease of sending a text cuts people off from each other. Texting might make communication seem more streamlined, but we miss out the joy of hearing our loved ones' voices on the other line.
	- In a conversation with YourTango CEO Andrea Miller on [YourTango's podcast, "Getting Open,"](https://youtu.be/vXMQtVC_QkI?si=bD7vQ0UxXje-JnDc) [psychologist Guy Winch revealed](https://www.yourtango.com/2023367409/it%E2%80%99s-time-swallow-our-pride-and-be-one-who-goes-first) why reaching out to other people is the only way to soothe loneliness.
	- "When you're lonely, you feel so alone, so raw, so rejected, so unseen, that the idea of reaching out and risking more rejection or a rebuff seems more than you can stand, so you don't," he explained. "You see on social media, everyone looks connected, happy, in groups, with friends, and you're sitting by yourself... and you feel like my emotional needs, my connection needs are not being met. And it's that gap that creates loneliness."
	- Winch described loneliness as an emotional wound, saying it's "something that needs healing. It needs proactivity on your part. Wounds, emotional ones, don't usually heal just by themselves that well. They need an assist, like any other wound."
	- He advocated for stepping up and doing the scariest thing imaginable: calling people first.
	- "You need to be brave, you need to start putting together the support as much as you can, and start advocating for yourself, and really start reaching out," he concluded.
	- ### 5. Going to the library
	- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-going-to-library.png){:width 675 :height 380} polinaloves | Shutterstock
	- It might seem super old-timey to sit quietly, surrounded by stacks of books, but libraries provide so much more than reading material. They're community spaces that offer free or low-cost classes and clubs. Going to the library is a way to stay connected, and the best part about it: it's free!
	- [Visiting the library is one habit](https://www.yourtango.com/self/gen-zers-and-millennials-have-adopted-unlikely-place-their-gathering-spot) that Gen Z and millennials have adopted as their own. They're walking down the road toward nostalgia and finding a wealth of access, along with that elusive "third space" outside of their homes and workplaces where they can go to find in-person communities.
	- **RELATED:** **10 Things Boomer Kids Did Growing Up That Would Make Gen Z Cry**
	- ### 6. Using coupons
	- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-coupons.png){:width 675 :height 380} PR Image Factory | Shutterstock
	- The idea of collecting coupons might conjure up the image of your grandma, sitting in her bathrobe on Sunday morning, cutting coupons out of the newspaper and storing them alphabetically in one of those little accordion-boxes. Coupons might not be fire, but in a world where groceries are more expensive than ever, using coupons just hits different.
	- Boomers are often criticized for their role in building their wealth in a way that's denied the generations after them that same access, yet their [frugal habits are something younger people can definitely learn from](https://www.yourtango.com/self/daily-habits-frugal-people-make-big-difference).
	- ### 7. Writing by hand
	- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-writing.png){:width 675 :height 380} Ground Picture | Shutterstock
	- A boomer habit people make fun of that is actually good for you is writing by hand. Typing might be faster than putting pen to paper, but we miss out on major cognitive processes when we don't write by hand. Writing by hand requires the different brain systems to work together.
	- For young kids, writing by hand builds a foundation for literacy later in life by improving memory and word recall. For adults, writing by hand helps people understand complex topics. Handwriting also forces us to slow down and pay attention to what we're putting on the page.
	- [As neuroscientist Ramesh Balasubramaniam explained](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/05/11/1250529661/handwriting-cursive-typing-schools-learning-brain), "There's actually some very important things going on during the embodied experience of writing by hand. It has important cognitive benefits." Writing by hand might seem more work, but it's actually really good for you, and for your brain.
	- ### 8. Fixing broken things instead of replacing them
	- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-fixing.png){:width 675 :height 380} BAZA Production | Shutterstock
	- Repairing broken things instead of replacing them is a solid way to save money and cut down on waste. Fixing things can also boost your sense of accomplishment since you're learning a new, hands-on skill.
	- Tinkering with a toaster oven might seem like a strange way to spend the weekend, but older appliances are often better built than their modern counterparts, which is an argument for not throwing them away.
	- Not all old-fashioned habits should be overlooked, especially [ones that help you live within your means](https://www.yourtango.com/self/old-fashioned-habits-bring-back-live-frugally). So, channel your inner boomer, strap on your tool belt and start fixing.

	- ### 9. Walking every day

	- Moving our bodies, even just a little every day, is essential for our physical and mental health. [According to the American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2022/11/defeating-depression-naturally), adults who got the recommended amount of weekly exercise, which breaks down to about 2.5 hours of walking, lowered their risk of depression by 25%.
	- [A study from Harvard Medical School](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1510363) discovered that access to nature can actually lower a person's mortality rate. "The truth is, we are nature," [Peter James, a professor at Harvard Medical School, explained](https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/walk-woods-may-boost-mental-health). "We were not evolved to be in a windowless room staring at a computer screen. These artificial environments make us stressed. They force us to focus more than we want to, and they tire our cognitive function."
	- [Walking every day is a simple and effective way](https://www.yourtango.com/experts/reino-gevers/why-walking-good-for-you) to shake up your routine and put your health first.
	- ### 10. Sending thank you notes
	- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-thank-you-notes.png){:width 675 :height 380} BAZA Production | Shutterstock
	- In an age of email and instant communication, taking the time to write and send a note feels special. It's an act of care and kindness that shows how much you truly appreciate someone.
	- Sending thank you notes is an important part of practicing gratitude, and [it shows you were raised with good manners](https://www.yourtango.com/self/phrases-people-use-raised-good-manners). There's nothing quite like the joy of seeing an envelope addressed to you, amidst piles of junk mail.
	- While some boomer habits are better left in the past, other habits should be brought back, because they actually improve your quality of life.

	- *During the 1920 US presidential election, [Warren G Harding](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/warren-g-harding/) campaigned with the slogan “[return to normalcy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/return-to-normalcy)” – a return to how things were before the first world war. This included deregulation and isolationism. He won with a decisive victory and in 1922 introduced the [Fordney-McCumber Tariff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordney%E2%80%93McCumber_Tariff), a law that raised American tariffs on many imported goods.*
	- ## America and Europe
	- From our New York correspondent
	  7 June 1922
	- Most internationally minded American observers who were at [Genoa](https://www.britannica.com/event/Conference-of-Genoa) or have been following recent events from Europe earnestly desire greater American participation in European affairs. Many thoughtful English liberals agree with them. But, curiously enough, many in America who share their hope that the United States may soon appreciate and bear her share of the world’s burdens and problems believe that participation by the American government in European conferences would at this time be futile and perhaps dangerous.
	- [Mr Hughes](https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/hughes-charles-evans) is a man of principle, but Mr Harding is a man of expediency. There is no doubt that the administration would like to take a larger part in European affairs; there is no doubt that the financial interests, to which it lends an attentive ear, are of the same mind; and there is also no doubt whatever that financial interest to which it lends and attentive ear, are of the same mind; and there is also no doubt whatever that the mass of American sentiment is steadfastly against it. The huge majority by which Mr Harding defeated the Democratic candidate in the autumn of 1920 was in large part a reaction against Mr Wilson’s entanglement in transatlantic politics.
	- In so far as recent byelections and primary elections can be interpreted as bearing upon foreign policy they show a clear sympathy with the “irreconcilables” who kept the United States out of the League. The Administration, which shifts its domestic policy after every vote in an effort to please the country, would be even more incapable of a clearcut foreign policy.
	- On the Russian question of course the United States has a policy – as intransigent as that of France. Mr Hughes and Mr Hoover, the two strong men of the Cabinet.
	- **A prejudice analysed**
	  The popular prejudice against participation in European affairs is often misinterpreted in [Europe](https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news). It is, in part, of course, merely content with the relative prosperity in America, a selfish unwillingness to bother about a sick continent so far away. But it is vastly more than that. The figures of private donations for relief in Northern France, in Germany, in Austria, in Russia – which mounted into the tens of millions last year and continue mounting – are one proof of that. To anyone in touch with the pulse of American life it is plain that the main reason for the hesitation to plunge into Europe is a kind of bewildered disappointment at the results of America’s last plunge. There is no confidence in America’s diplomatic wisdom. The ordinary American farmer has two strong convictions – first, that the Europeans are making a mess of things; and, second, that the Americans, while they were in Europe, helped to make the mess worse. He would like to help, but he is unwilling to sign more blank cheques. He is confused; the issue is not clear, and until it is he thinks it safer to keep out. Where Wilson failed, he argues, what reason is there to believe that Harding and Hughes would succeed?
	- There were during the Genoa Conference, when Europe seemed to be doing things on its own account, that American feeling was changing. The disappointing result at Genoa was tragic in its effect upon America. It did help still further to destroy the myth of a romantic France that could do no wrong; but tended to make the country still less disposed to mix in European problems. Yet other factors are at work. The discussion of the tariff, in which the New York banks that give the tone to financial opinion throughout the country are almost unanimously arguing for Free Trade, is very salutary indeed.
	- The Genoa despatches of Mr Keynes and of Mr [Frank Vanderlip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_A._Vanderlip), the former president of the National City Bank, attracted widespread comment and had a profound educative effect. But the bewildered apathy remains, and while it remains useful American participation in European affairs will be confined to the action of individuals such as Mr Morgan and Mr Vanderlip. It will take some striking event to galvanise American opinion. If the French should undertake independent military action they would certainly be unanimously condemned in this country; such an act might well give the Administration the popular support it requires for an effective return to the councils of Europe.
	- ## The US tariff bill
	- By FW Hirst
	  24 June 1922
	- Under the proposed [Fordney-McCumber Tariff Bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordney%E2%80%93McCumber_Tariff), which the Republican leaders hope to get through this summer, the United States tariff will make import duties on clothing, boots, and most of our staple manufactures almost prohibitive. To quote one paragraph from a very careful analysis by the New York World which lies before me:
	- > Importations would be placed under a virtual embargo, thereby blocking Europe’s only means of paying off her war debt of more than eleven thousand million dollars to the United States. The economically unhealthy gold surplus would remain in this country – over 40 per-cent of the world’s gold supply is now in Federal Revenue bank vaults –instead of flowing back to normal channels and stabilising exchanges.
	- The World declares that the agents of the big industrial monopolies have lobbied at Washington with more success than ever before.

	- ## Editorial: America’s new tariff
	- 22 September 1922

	- President Warren G Harding, circa 1920s. Photograph: AP
	- President Harding has at last signed the new United States Tariff Bill. The Bill, as is well known, conforms to the Republican tradition of high protection, but carries it to a higher power than has ever before been attempted, and considerably higher, one suspects, than most Americans like. How, in that case, it has managed to survive a sustained fire of criticism and is finally to become law on the eve of the congressional elections is a little obscure. As a vote-catching device nothing could have been more unfortunately conceived, and the Democrats are doubtless surprised and delighted to have a weapon with so sharp an edge put into their hands. Their chances at the November elections are now brighter, even though their victory could not immediately enable them to repeal the new tariff.
	- The Bill has been much pulled about during the year it has been under discussion, but in its final shape it is still the most extreme measure of Protection ever passed in an industrial State. It is hardly conceivable that it should last long, and already there are signs of reaction from the frenzied Protectionism in which it had its birth after the sensational collapse in prices and restriction of credit in 1920. It has been carried partly because the Republican party was committed to it, partly because the farmers had to be bribed with heavy duties on all kinds of agricultural produce, and partly because, in spite of a general feeling that the general level of duties was extravagantly high, no trade could be induced to admit that it really needed anything less than prohibition. The Bill, once it was introduced, was carried more by its own momentum than by any active belief in its all-round virtues. It has been carried against much public criticism, and may be followed, like the similar Payne-Aldrich Tariff of 1909, by Democratic successes at the polls. But, whatever its effects upon the internal politics of America may be, it will probably remain for a year or two as the expression of American tariff policy, and will have far reaching effects upon the trade of America with the rest of the world.
	- From a European point of view the Fordney-McCumber tariff is without any redeeming feature. It fits in only too well with the American policy of self-isolation. This is a policy which can be perfectly well understood even on this side of the Atlantic. If it were practicable there are many who would like to adopt it for England. But even if it were morally defensible to say that the Continent’s troubles are no concern of ours, and that we need not incur the odium and expense of mixing ourselves up in them, it is manifest to everybody that in point of fact that Europe’s troubles are very much our affair and that isolation would be the most dangerous and costly policy of all.
	- In America there is the same inducement to cut clear of a continent which looks like falling to pieces and much less obvious reason why isolation even for her, is impracticable. At least the United States would not starve, as most people in England would, if the whole of her foreign trade were cut off. But though she would not starve she would be a good deal poorer, and she could not profess indifference even to the loss of her trade with Europe, which still takes over half of her total exports and used to take more than that. How much of America’s foreign trade will be destroyed by the new tariff cannot be foreseen. Many of the new duties are described as prohibitive, and a good many more will become so if the President exercises his arbitrary powers of increasing them.

	- As a children’s author, I often visit schools for one-off writing workshops or small residencies but rarely do I have the opportunity to work with students over a longer period. It’s expensive to host an artist, and extended projects can disrupt timetables and regular teaching, so they need to be thoroughly integrated.
	- The undertaking of a more comprehensive project is not just beneficial to students. It also shapes the artist.
	- I always enter the planning stage with expectations and assumptions, and within a week they are dismantled. And, as corny as it sounds, as much as I can teach the students, I always come away feeling that they have taught me much more.
	- This year I’ve spent two months teaching [memoir](https://www.theguardian.com/books/autobiography-and-memoir) writing to students in years 3 to 6. The project is funded by Creative Victoria and is one of many that run annually across the state. Each project sees the pairing of an artist with a school community and together they design an approach to teach students how to express themselves using a particular art form.
	- I came late to writing memoir and, at first, I found it difficult to write about myself. I worried about being seen as arrogant or undeserving. I had people question what I’d done to warrant publishing a book about my life and, initially, I agreed with them. But as I read more published memoirs I began to understand that the form isn’t only a domain for the famous. We all have life stories, we just need to learn how to tell them. It took time to find the confidence to share my experiences but now I find it freeing in a way that writing fiction isn’t always for me. I think students often feel the same.
	- Even without fully developed writing skills, writing your story is accessible. For young people, who often struggle with coming up with an idea or knowing how to start or finish, that can be liberating. They have lived the story, now they just have to work out how to write it. And primary students don’t second-guess themselves when they write. They admit to fears on the page. They talk about emotions. About love. They don’t worry about being judged. They just wade straight in. Regardless of their writing ability, that is a powerful thing.
	- This project was designed as a way to talk about journeys, because many of the students at the school in Melbourne’s outer north have come from other places. But one of the things I love most about working with young people is that, when they take ownership of a project, they make it theirs. And instead of writing about their journeys, many decided to write about moments in their lives that mattered more. A beloved grandfather’s funeral, a family trip to eat halal snack pack, feeling torn between two countries and not knowing where you belong, a fire in a couch started by a younger brother, a declaration of friendship for a student in another class and theme park rollercoasters. So many rollercoasters.
	- Last term we published a book of short memoirs written by the 60 students in the two older grades. We had a launch with snacks and readings, and speeches from the local MP and the principal. To make the event inclusive, a teacher recorded every student reading their memoir then embedded the recordings with QR codes so they could be listened to.
	- We took the project seriously. We gave a voice to kids who don’t always expect to be heard. And we celebrated all of them.
	- At the launch the students clutched their copies of the book and hunted for their names. Then they began to read each other’s work, and share in each other’s stories, and perhaps learning something about someone else that they didn’t know before. The project isn’t assessed and it’s not a curriculum task. It’s about self-expression and learning the value of sharing your story.
	- I believe we all need to experience that. No matter how old we are.
