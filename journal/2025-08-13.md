	- using grep
		- A bash script can be used to choose a file based on its content by leveraging the grep command. This can be achieved in several ways, depending on whether the script needs to:
	- **Find files containing a specific pattern and then allow the user to select one:**
	  collapsed:: true
		- | 
		  
		  ```
		  #!/bin/bash
		  
		    read -p "Enter the pattern to search for: " search_pattern
		    read -p "Enter the directory to search in (e.g., . for current): " search_dir
		  
		    # Find files containing the pattern and store them in an array
		    # -l: only print the names of files containing matches
		    # -R: recursive search
		    files_found=($(grep -l -R "$search_pattern" "$search_dir"))
		  
		    if [ ${#files_found[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
		        echo "No files found containing the pattern '$search_pattern'."
		        exit 0
		    fi
		  
		    echo "Files found containing '$search_pattern':"
		    PS3="Select a file to open (enter number): "
		    select chosen_file in "${files_found[@]}"; do
		        if [[ -n "$chosen_file" ]]; then
		            echo "You selected: $chosen_file"
		            # You can add actions here, e.g., open with a text editor
		            # nano "$chosen_file"
		            break
		        else
		            echo "Invalid selection. Please try again."
		        fi
		    done
		  ```
		  
		  |
		  
		  This script first prompts for a search pattern and a directory. It then uses grep -l -R to find all files within that directory (and its subdirectories) that contain the specified pattern, storing the filenames in an array. Finally, it presents a numbered list of these files, allowing the user to select one using the select command.
	- **Filter a predefined list of files based on content:**
		- ```
		  #!/bin/bash
		  
		    read -p "Enter the pattern to search for: " search_pattern
		  
		    # Assuming a file named 'filelist.txt' contains paths to files to check
		    # Each line in filelist.txt should be a full or relative path to a file
		    
		    # Filter files from filelist.txt that contain the pattern
		    chosen_files=$(grep -l -f <(grep "$search_pattern" filelist.txt) filelist.txt)
		  
		    if [ -z "$chosen_files" ]; then
		        echo "No files in filelist.txt found containing the pattern '$search_pattern'."
		        exit 0
		    fi
		  
		    echo "Files from filelist.txt containing '$search_pattern':"
		    PS3="Select a file to open (enter number): "
		    select chosen_file in $chosen_files; do
		        if [[ -n "$chosen_file" ]]; then
		            echo "You selected: $chosen_file"
		            # nano "$chosen_file"
		            break
		        else
		            echo "Invalid selection. Please try again."
		        fi
		    done
		  ```
		  
		  |
		  
		  This script assumes a filelist.txt containing paths to files. It uses grep to filter this list, keeping only those files whose content matches the search_pattern. The select command then allows the user to choose from the filtered list. 
		  
		  Key grep options used:
	- Find files
	- -l: (lowercase L) Only print the names of files that contain matches, not the matching lines themselves.
	- -R: Recursively search directories.
	- gg-f &lt;file&gt;: Obtain patterns from &lt;file&gt;, one per line.
	- -q: Suppress all normal output; exit immediately with 0 status if any match is found, 1 otherwise. Useful for conditional checks.

- Peter and Doris
	- Mary Pat has read to me an exchange initiated by Doris on Facebook about communion. Since you quickly responded to the thread, I felt prompted to make this comment. It’s not on social media. It’s just a private communication. But you and Doris might be more cautious in your dismissive comments about the poor theology related to the order of communion. I’m not a neophyte with regards to theology and for myself I regularly have to disregard practices that I find not just wrong headed but seriously misguided. It’s troubling that theological principles that I hold dearly might be so casually dismissed. I do believe you didn’t mean to do that. But it turns out words matter. Even on social media.
