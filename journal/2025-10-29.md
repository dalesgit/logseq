	- ### grep? ripgrep? The Silver Searcher? Which Tool is Best to Find Text in Files?
	- grep is the established tool for full-text file search on the command line. But alternatives are available, like ripgrep, ag, and sift. But should you switch and, if so, which should be your search tool of choice? Let’s find out.
	- ## How Does grep Work?
	  
	  grep is one of the most useful Linux tools available, and it has been for half a century. Its name stands for Global Regular Expression Print, but it’s really after an old ed command: g/re/p. This command is [adept at searching text](https://www.howtogeek.com/496056/how-to-use-the-grep-command-on-linux/), especially using the powerful language of [regular expressions](https://www.howtogeek.com/get-started-with-regex-in-linux-terminal/).
	  
	  You can start simply, with a basic text search:
	  
	  ```
	  grep 'TODO' journal.md
	  ```
	  
	  And, eventually, you'll be crafting complex pattern matches:
	  
	  ```
	  grep -E "^([0-9]{4})-([0-9]{2})-([0-9]{2})" dates.txt
	  ```
	  
	  This example shows the raw power of grep: it uses extended regular expressions to match lines that begin with a simple ISO date, like 2025-10-26. You can also use grep in your pipelines, to great effect. For example, this command will output lines from an Apache log, in real time, if the server sent a “not modified” status:
	  
	  ```
	  tail -f /var/log/apache2/access_log | grep '" 304'
	  ```
	  
	  And one final great grep feature: recursive search. Running “grep -r pattern” will search all files within your current directory and below, printing each matching result. This makes grep a perfect tool for finding files that contain whatever text pattern you need to search for:
	  
	  ```
	  grep -ri todo
	  ```
	- ## What Does ripgrep Do Better?
	  
	  grep is ubiquitous and has possibly done more than any other program to demonstrate the power of Unix: focused programs, working collaboratively, communicating by piping textual data. So, why look elsewhere?
	  
	  ripgrep is a popular, modern alternative to grep, and it’s one of [the best upgrades to a default command](https://www.howtogeek.com/replace-default-linux-commands-with-these-alternatives/) you can make. You can install it with a wide range of package managers, using a command like **brew install ripgrep**, **sudo apt-get install ripgrep**, **sudo dnf install ripgrep**, or [the appropriate command for your system](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#user-content-installation). Once installed, you’ll run it as rg (not ripgrep), using a similar approach to grep. For example, to find all headings in a markdown file:
	  
	  ```
	  rg '^#' README.md
	  ```
	  
	  The earliest version of ripgrep arrived in 2016 and took advantage of the relatively new Rust programming language. Generally speaking, thanks to some excellent optimization of the regular expression engine in Rust, ripgrep is faster than the alternatives, especially grep, which can be up to ten times slower.
	  
	  You may not notice this kind of speed benefit with day-to-day use. But if you’re launching longer-running searches—particularly recursive ones, across many files, with more complex patterns—ripgrep can offer big benefits. Recursive search is ripgrep’s default, so much so that the following command is all you need to search for a pattern in all files inside and below the current directory:
	  
	  ```
	  rg PATTERN
	  ```
	  
	  For a rough benchmark, I carried out a simple (non-rigorous) test using a directory with about 40,000 files underneath it. The grep command took 30 seconds to complete, while ripgrep took just under 1s. Now, these results will undoubtedly vary based on several factors, but ripgrep definitely performs better in my day-to-day use.
	  
	  ![A command line showing a recursive grep search completing in 30 seconds, while the same search using ripgrep takes 0.6 seconds.](https://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/linux-grep-versus-ripgrep.png?q=70&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=1)
	  
	  One reason that ripgrep is so fast is its multi-threaded model, which runs a recursive search in parallel. An interesting side-effect is that you'll (probably) see results in a different order each time you run the same search. If this is a problem, use the **--sort path** option.
	  
	  But ripgrep’s pros go beyond mere speed; the program has an extensive feature set, too. One of the simplest is the support for a range of language-specific filter options, e.g.:
	  
	  ```
	  rg --type sh 'todo'
	  ```
	  
	  This will perform a recursive search from the current directory, looking only in shell scripts for the pattern "todo". The tool supports an extensive list of file types, which you can display with the --type-list option:
	  
	  ![A list of file types that ripgrep can filter by, including asciidoc, asp, awk, bzip2, and c.](https://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/linux-ripgrep-type-list-2.png?q=70&fit=crop&w=756&dpr=1)
	  
	  The ripgrep command is recursive by nature, but even this behavior can be controlled, using the --max-depth option. Simply run **rg --max-depth 1 PATTERN** and your search will emulate a basic grep, limited to files in your current directory.
	  
	  In keeping with many modern programs, ripgrep supports git in the sense that it will read [a .gitignore file](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/what-is-a-gitignore-file-and-how-do-you-configure-it/) and ignore the same files. This will only happen in recursive mode, and there are plenty of configuration options to let you tweak this functionality.
	  
	  ripgrep has many more features. It can skip files larger than a given size (--max-filesize), show summary information (--stats), use smart case searching (based on the case of letters in your pattern), and search inside gzip files.
	- ## What Other Terminal Search Tools Are There?
	  
	  Although grep is firmly established as the default search tool, and ripgrep is the most popular alternative, there are a few other programs worth checking out.
	- ### ack
	  
	  [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/) is a similar tool that is mostly compatible with grep, written in Perl. Again, it’s recursive by default, which is a convenience. It also operates similarly to ripgrep, inspecting files that it recognizes—by type—but ignoring others. However, that doesn’t extend to files matched by .gitignore files, although ack will ignore any .git directories.
	  
	  ack has a curious -f option that prints the paths of all files that it would search, without actually searching them. This might not seem that useful, but you can leverage ack’s other features with it, using it to print a list of all files (a bit like “find .”) or all files of a given type. The option will work in conjunction with .gitignore, so it’s a useful way of finding files within a source code repository.
	  
	  In my experience, ack is faster than grep, but it’s not as speedy as ripgrep.
	- ### The Silver Searcher
	  
	  The ag command runs a program called [The Silver Searcher](https://geoff.greer.fm/ag/), which plays on the phrase “Silver Surfer” and references the chemical symbol for silver.
	  
	  ag is a very solid alternative to ripgrep. It’s not quite as fast as rg in my usage, but it almost is. The difference isn’t so much that you’d notice it unless you’re running benchmarking tests or carrying out very complex searches.
	  
	  But ag can do many of the same things that rg can: it honors .gitignore files, matches across newlines, searches inside binary files, and can print summary stats.
	- ### Sift
	  
	  [Sift](https://sift-tool.org/) is yet another text search tool, this time written in Go. It’s recursive by default, with an option to turn that off. While rg’s output groups results by file, sift prints the full path before each match. This approach sacrifices human readability for machine readability, so by default, it may be easier for scripting.
	  
	  Like ag, sift is fast, if not quite as speedy as rg. It defaults to searching as many files as possible, including binaries and files mentioned in .gitignore. However, you can ignore either set of files using the --binary-skip and --git options, respectively.
	  
	  Sift has no [man page](https://www.howtogeek.com/663440/how-to-use-linuxs-man-command-hidden-secrets-and-basics/), which I consider a flaw, although it does provide useful information with the --help option.
	  
	  ---
	  
	  If you’re still using grep, any of these tools will feel like a significant upgrade. ripgrep is my personal favorite because it feels so polished and its long list of features enables many different types of powerful searches. Its sheer speed, compared with grep, has to be seen to be believed.
	  
	  It’s always nice to have alternatives: an open-source ecosystem with healthy competition should make for better software all round. That said, there’s little to differentiate these tools for typical use, other than the languages they are programmed in. ripgrep is certainly the fastest (just) and is probably your best bet unless you need some very specific options.
	  
	  The reassuring news is that ripgrep is still in active development, most recently releasing version 15.0.0 in October. ack is still being developed, with a bit less frequency, while sift and ag have both pretty much ceased to update.
