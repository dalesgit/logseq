			- Good morning.
			- This is just a little post to introduce myself. Over the last couple of weeks, thanks to @Diana Butler Bass, more people have connected with me. Thank you.
			- I am a 55-year-old progressive Southerner. I am an ordained Baptist minister who worships with the Episcopalians. I was confirmed in 2015. I live as part of a neo-monastic community in Richmond, Virginia. I serve as the pastoral director of that same community, Richmond Hill.
			- Check us out at [www.richmondhillva.org](www.richmondhillva.org).
			- My wife and I live here with our son who is 10 years old. We also have a cat named Wilbur. He is 16.
			- I write about Christian spirituality and faith. I do so through the lens of racial repair. I am a trained liturgical scholar and ethnomusicologist. Iâ€™m also a bit of a musician.
			- Thank you for connecting with me. I look forward to getting to know you all.
