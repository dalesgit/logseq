	- He seemed particularly interested in treating I think he called it rosacea or something like that, and it was the dry skin and white spots along my shins and feet.
	- The assistant said that that putting the treatment for the fungus on my big toe, a little toe, especially, look at the white skin on edges, that if I put Vaseline first, let that soak in, then the absorption is better for the antifungal.
	- The black road was removed and will be biopsy.
	- He didnâ€™t talk about cyst but the assistant did who said that if it was bothersome, they would cut it open and try to squeeze as much out as possible. It may be that it would have to be sutured afterwards, but maybe not.
	- Returning in 2 1/2 weeks to see how the black growth has healed.
