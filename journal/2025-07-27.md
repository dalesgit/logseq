- Sermon DCH #sermon
	- People liked my sermon
	- #names Ethan reported to me that he is leaving in two weeks for law school in Miami. He seems to have gone to college or school up in Boston. He’s glad to be around family here in Florida.
	- #names Bob wanted to talk to me about his wrestling with the concept of love. What does it mean?
		- It’s an elusive concept. General, but how to put it into specific practice? He was adamant that the opposite of love is indifference.
		- He feels a lot of indifference at this point. Partly related to his growing old and reminiscing about his past.
		- He was particularly moved by Peter‘s last sermon on who is your neighbor. Especially he noticed the prevalence of projecting. Our assumption sent inherited concepts when we meet the other.
	- #names Diane Vetter went to a Peter Paul and Mary concert years ago. With her husband and a friend. The friend was a childhood friend of Paul Stuckey. He recognized him and it led to the group of them meeting and talking with Peter Paul and Mary.
