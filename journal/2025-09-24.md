	- That’s a good question- the term seems to have quite a few different meanings. Here’s how I’m using it: Progressive Christianity is a way of following Jesus that puts compassion, inclusion, and justice at the centre of the Christian tradition. It takes the Bible very seriously, but not always literally, and sees faith as something that develops and changes - something that responds to experience (new insights, new voices, and the realities of the world we live in). It’s not about throwing tradition away so much as it is about asking how tradition can serve love rather than limit it. To my mind it necessarily leads to action and engagement, and that requires listening to people who’ve been excluded, questioning and dismantling systems that harm, and trusting that love is always bigger than anything which we might fear. Others will have different ways of seeing this, of course. Peace.
