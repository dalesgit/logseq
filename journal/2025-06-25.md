For help setting up wiki.vim in nvim cf.
https://www.google.com/search?q=set+up+wiki.vim+nvim&rlz=1CAVMHK_enUS1160&oq=set+up+wiki.vim+nvim&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDQ5MjRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8o
But note this covers also vimwiki.
The git files for wiki.vim under "lua"  may provide help in the setup. I have deleted "Obsidian" for the moment because of the confusion it causes.The main loss may be the search for tags.
