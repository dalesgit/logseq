- # LPL with Michael & David
	- In the fall normal review of RMD's
		- move to annual draws for next year
		- turn off the extra draw coming from my account
		- because we're going to annual (any left over we can just get a small check to cover what we have to withdraw)
	- Will need more $ for bathrooms. MPS will decide.
		- $18K from me
		- $12K from MPS
	- I have turned on all "paperless"
- Cruise $,
- But we are basically living off of our normal income, not the portfolio
- Lindsay will be our contact when he is taking time with his newborn in Dec/Jan.
- For the moment we are somewhat insulated because we are not living off the portfolio. (**every year shit happens to disrupt income**)
- "fundamentals are strong"
- maybe up to $10K for patio (pavers are better)
- KnockBox and all the other details. The **work** of getting (*estate planning*) portfolio in order -- is a **gift** to those who come after. Michael: so often struggle couple trying to deal with death of parents.
	- We need to get somebody on the liquid accounts so the accounts could be settled. cf. ala Bill and Mom. On title? Michael says probably not because they would be vulnerable to cost basis taxes issues.
