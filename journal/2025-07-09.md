  collapsed:: true
	- God of this moment,
	  When the water has taken too much and the silence feels heavy, be near.
	  For those who are grieving, bring steady breath.
	  For those still searching, bring strength that holds.
	  For all of us, bring the kind of courage that stays when answers do not come.
	  Help us face what is here and what is still unknown.
	  Be in the waiting.
	  Be in the heartbreak.
	  Be in the hands that hold each other now.
	  We need you.
	  *Adapted from the New Zealand Prayer Book*
	- From Teagan:
	  This mountain trail
	  refuses to culminate.
	  Instead it points downwards,
	  decreasing in birdsong,
	  gravel path devolving into tiers of mud.
	  Twisting tree roots hold tight to the body of the mountain,
	  yet landslide lets loose,
	  a one hundred foot vertical gash of silt
	  and a brand-new patch of flat light,
	  burying a community of trees
	  in a wet, cool underworld.
	  Here, form is broken down,
	  and the bodies of forest and path
	  are deconstructed into water, mineral, space -
	  When there's no longer a way forward
	  I creep back the way I came
	  and stand in the stream with muddy shoes, letting clear water wash the fine grey substance away ~ ~ ~
	  If ever I was part of a community body
	  I am now a particle of slipped clay
	  carried by current
	  perhaps to be taken up as a needed mineral
	  into the roots of a great tree
	  or the body of a thirsty elk
	  Or perhaps,
	  in this time of collapse,
	  I am a crystalline fragment
	  a fractal key
	  the future nucleation site
	  of a novel and durable geometry
