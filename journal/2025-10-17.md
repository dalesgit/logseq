- Aliases and external links
  tags:: [[logseq]] [[tech]]
  collapsed:: true
	- use, e.g. for "MP"
	- It's also possible to link to pages outside of Logseq, i.e. websites. To point to a URL, either use the trigger menu by typing `/link` or use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd-l` (macOS)/`Ctrl-l` (Windows) to add the following shortcode to the block: `[]()`. Between the brackets (`[ ]`), put the label (name) of the link. Between the parenthesis, put the URL:
	- `[This is the label or name of the link](https://thisistheurl.com)`
	- Apart from linking to pages outside of Logseq, you can also use the alias function to link to an internal page. This is handy for when you want to show a different label for an internal link. For example, `[I worked on projects]([[Projects]])` will make the entire "I worked on projects" sentence clickable and point it to the *Projects* page.
	- Finally, for aliases that you use often it's best to add a page alias. For example, you might want the link `[[PKM]]` to point to the page `Personal Knowledge Management`. To do this, add the following in the **first block** of the page `Personal Knowledge Management`: `alias:: PKM`
	- Now, anytime you click a `[[PKM]]` link, you'll end up on the `Personal Knowledge Management` page.
- Zotero
	- "local api is not enabled"
	- In the Zotero settings in logseq I needed the code note the name of the API
	- finally got it to work 13:08
