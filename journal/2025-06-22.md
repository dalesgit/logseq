- TODO lunch with Larry Hooper
- 20:03 I called #Lydia before dinner. She called back in the midst of mine. Her voice still seemed upbeat. She reported that sometimes her job is boring. But it could be worse. She is planning next month to go to a dietitian to help her be "accountable" for what she is eating. They were at "the pool", which she called "x's" pool -- what is his name? With the youngest (5 y/o) whose named Ezra.
