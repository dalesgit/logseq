	- The office was recently contacted by a long-timer who pointed out that the following article provides a list of spiritual
	  **virtues**
	- (not principles) that originated from a plaque which was sold years ago and may originally came from a Grapevine article or other AA newsletter. It is known in the rooms of AA that the spiritual principles are the Twelve Steps. To be thorough, the 36 principles are the

	- ,
	  [Twelve Traditions](https://www.aacle.org/what-is-aa/twelve-traditions/)
	- and
	  [Twelve Concepts](https://www.aacle.org/product/the-12-concepts-for-world-service/)
	- .

	- Bill W. considered each step to be a spiritual principle in and of itself. However, particularly in the 12 & 12, he outlined the spiritual principles behind each step. Some of them seem like common sense, but understand going into the exercise that reading these principles and actually *practicing them in your day-to-day lives* are two entirely different things (and that the latter requires vigilance and willingness).
	- 1. **HONESTY** – Fairness and straight forwardness of conduct: adherence to the facts.
	  2. **HOPE** – To expect with desire; something on which hopes are centered.
	  3. **FAITH** – Complete confidence; belief and trust.
	  4. **COURAGE** – Firmness of mind and will in the face of extreme difficulty; mental or moral strength to withstand fear.
	  5. **INTEGRITY** – The quality or state of being complete or undivided; soundness.
	  6. **WILLINGNESS** – Prompt to act or respond; accepted and done of choice or without reluctance.
	  7. **HUMILITY** – Not proud or haughty; not arrogant or assertive; a clear and concise understanding of what we are, followed by a sincere desire to become what we can be.
	  8. **LOVE** – Unselfish concern that freely accepts another in loyalty and seeks his good to hold dear.
	  9. **DISCIPLINE** – Training that corrects, molds, or perfects the mental faculties or moral character; to bring under control; to train or develop by instruction.
	  10. **PATIENCE/PERSEVERANCE** – Steadfast despite opposition or adversity; able or willing to bear; to persist in an understanding in spite of counter influences.
	  11. **AWARENESS** – Alive and alert; vigilance in observing.
	  12. **SERVICE** – A helpful act; contribution to the welfare of others; useful labor that does not produce a tangible commodity.
